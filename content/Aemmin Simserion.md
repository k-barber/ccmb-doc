One of [[Momen Tomori|Momen's]] former necromancy students. He was clever and studious, but emotionally unstable. He was expelled after it came to light that he was conducting experiments on his fellow students.

2) Completing his grandfather's research

Things that piss off Momen
- A lone-wolf mentality, esp. fratricide
- A research practice where any non-useful leads are discarded and forgotten
	- Extending that to people
-
