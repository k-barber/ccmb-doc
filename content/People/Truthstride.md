The "Bard of dragon romance". While Truthstride is just a halfling, he is well versed on the coming-and-goings of dragons. When he met with the CCMB, he made three prophecies and asked three questions, each referring to a different dragon.
## Crowned and Seated at the Head of the Table
This was Truthstride's prophecy about [[Aodreia ― The Lord of Ice|The Lord of Ice]], [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ|the Empress]], and [[Alfred Oberstein Ⅲ|King Alfred]].

>Consider, for a moment - The most powerful woman in the world, crowned and seated at the head of the table. Before her are two men:
>
>One is the love of her life, a man she has known since she was a child, one who would and has died for her.
>
>The other is her most powerful ally. It is through his power that she now controls the world. Without him, her empire would likely crumble.
>
>Unbeknownst to her, these two men vying for her attention are each conspiring to kill the other. In less than one year's time she will find herself at a crossroads, and will need to chose who to spare and who to kill.
>
>What do you think, who should she chose?

The CCMB answered that she should choose the lover of her life, tying your fate to [[Alfred Oberstein Ⅲ#Plan to Defeat the Lord of Ice|Alfred's Plan to Defeat the Lord of Ice]].

## The Serpent Fated to Devour the Sun
This was Truthstride's prophecy about [[Níðhöggr ― The Serpent]] and [[Níðhöggr ― The Usurper]].

>Consider, for a moment - The serpent fated to devour the sun. It grows ever larger, gorging itself on murderers, betrayers, and the nightmares of mortals - There seems to be no end to it's appetite. Then one day, a newt bites the serpent's tail. The serpent thinks nothing of the newt assuming it will simply fall off, but the next time it turns it's head, the newt has grown - and it continues to grow. The serpent now fears that rather than swallow the sun, it will be swallowed by the newt - The serpent has such an appetite that it's head is now too far from it's tail to reach. The serpent sees a group of travelling adventurers and asks them to remove the newt.

>What do you think, who should the adventurer's assist - the serpent or the usurper?

The CCMB answered that she should choose the lover of her life, tying your fate to [[Níðhöggr ― The Usurper#The Usurper's Attempt to Dethrone a God|The Usurper's Attempt to Dethrone a God]].
## The Bloodthirsty Beast
This was Truthstride's prophecy about [[Caylbaid ― The Quiet]] and [[Qyldryt ― The Patient]].

>Consider, for a moment - The bloodthirsty beast - He has killed people and beasts by the dozens and the hundreds - till one day, while laying waste to a town, a young elf girl grabs ahold of his tail. The bloodthirsty beast stops his attack and finds himself intrigued by the elf. Many years pass and the beast has not killed since. He spends his days enamored by the elf girl. Eventually they have a son - like his father, a beast; like his mother, kind. A gentle beast.
>
>"A freak of nature!", cry out the people.
>
>"The beast and the elf ought to be separated!"
>
>"The beast cannot be forgiven!"
>
>"The beast belongs with the other beasts!"
>
>He sends his son away, hoping to appease the people, but still they cry out in anger.
>
>What do you think, should the beast stay with the elf or return to the beasts?

The CCMB answered that the beast should stay with the elf, tying your fate to The Downfall of Qyldryt.
