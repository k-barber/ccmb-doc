An admiral in [[The Empire of Datrus]]' navy. He was born in [[Cedar Combe]] and had a very impressive record. Died in the [[Battle of Wapeboro Deep]], the only battle he ever lost.

In the southern half of the South Hill Memorial Gardens is a statue, with a plaque:

> Clay Walsh
> 
> 584 - 660
> 
> Here lies Clay Walsh, a royal admiral who called Cedar Combe his home. His fleet
> 
> of seventy ships were primarily stationed in East Sunset Bay Harbor. He was well known
> 
> for his bravery, and determination. It is said that he never took off his fatigues
> 
> and so it was only fitting to bury him in the clothes that he lived in. This statue
> 
> was erected over his grave to honour his memory. His long and decorated naval
> 
> career spanned more than fifty years, during which he won one hundred sixty two battles
> 
> and lost only one, the legendary [[Battle of Wapeboro Deep]]. More information about
> 
> his death can be found in the [[Kemany]] Library under "Wapeboro Deep, Battle of the".
