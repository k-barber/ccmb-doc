An elf that appears to be a week older than time itself. He speaks of events from thousands of years in the past, as though he were in attendance.

He's the Cedar Combe Monster Basher's librarian.

Despite his messy workspace, he is quite organized.

**You can talk to him to get information about monsters before you head off to fight.**

**Services:**

- **Identify a monster** 1 SP - Tell Goras about a monster you have encountered to have him identify what it was
- **Guess the monster** 1 GP - Show Goras a quest listing to get his opinion on what monsters might be present
- **Monster Research** (Ask for prices) - Goras researches a monster and provides you with insight into its strengths and weaknesses. Price varies by monster challenge rating, and by how thorough the research is. Research comes in five thoroughness levels (Sloppy, Basic, Standard, Advanced, Guaranteed) which determine how much information is given. Researching monsters can reveal up to 6 pieces of information:
    
    1. Size & Type & Alignment
    2. Senses & Languages
    3. Vulnerabilities, Resistances & Immunities
    4. AC, Hitpoints & Speed
    5. Special Traits
    6. Actions
