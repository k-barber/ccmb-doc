The "guardian" dragon of [[The Empire of Datrus]]. While most commoners in the empire are unaware of him, the nobility is taught of him as the god who blessed [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅰ ― The First Datrus|the first Aodreia]] so that she could defeat [[The Primal Host]], which had occupied the region.

Since then, he has occasionally bestowed his name and power upon beautiful women of the Datrian royal family. Specifically he has given his powers to:

- [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅰ ― The First Datrus]]
- [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅱ]]
- [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ]]
- [[Sofia Datrus Ⅷ]] (allegedly)

Because of this, descending into [[The Imperial Crypt]] to meet with The Lord of Ice is an important ritual for any Datrian ruler-to-be.
