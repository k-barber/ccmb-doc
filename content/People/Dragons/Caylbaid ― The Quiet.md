A lithe, battle hardened green dragon. His right eye is milky, with a large scar on the eyelid around it. He has a patch of smaller, darker scales on his left shoulder. His pale green scales have many scratches and scrapes.

He controls a large section of [[The Astain Wetlands]]. His epithet is "The Quiet", although according to [[Truthstride]], it used to be "The Bloodthirsty".

He was helping [[Maglubiyet's Spear]] in their invasion of the Great Badger Expanse.

He has asked the CCMB to help him complete his collection of paintings by [[Euric Mugwort]]. The only painting he is missing is a portrait of [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅰ ― The First Datrus|Aodreia Datrus Ⅰ ― The First Datrus]], which is in [[Aodreia ― The Lord of Ice|The Lord of Ice's]] possession.
