A silvery, metallic, and mercurial dragon. She has the ability to transform into a puddle.

Enveloped within her is a skeleton, with a black crown attached to it's skull. [[Marquis Marquaad]] confirmed that the skeleton within was [[Torveld Datrus]], based on the gash over her left eye socket.

She seems to harbor an intense hatred of [[The Empire of Datrus]], and the mere mention of it is enough to trigger a psychotic rage.

This anger is likely a result of [[Hydrargyrum ― The Quick#The Black Crown|The Black Crown's]] influence on Hydrargyrum's mind.

She is served by [[Duke Geoff Reinhardt]].
## The Black Crown
The crown is the former crown of [[The Empire of Datrus|Datrus]]. It was created by [[Aodreia ― The Lord of Ice]] out of blackfrost so that the Datrian royal family could bend Datrus to their will. It was stolen by [[Torveld Datrus]] when she fled the country.

The crown slowly bends the will of those around it to the will of the wearer.

The strength of the brainwashing is dependent on proximity to the crown and how long the target has been near the crown.

Small pieces artifact emanate shadows. The only safe way to store them is within a mirrored box, or a very shiny dragon.
