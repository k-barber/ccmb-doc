The Viscount of Wyrmwood gave you a lot of documents relating to your father's disappearance, so it will take some time to go through. As you find relevant information, it will be added here.
## What you know

- The storm happened during the Datrus/Torveldus war
- Spesof and his father were travelling south through the Narrow Strait, presumably from the Tundra Harbor and Yggdrasil
- The weather patterns appeared very suddenly, leading to speculation that the storm was not caused by natural weather patterns, but by the wizard who lives in the peninsula North of Datrus
- Spesof washed ashore in the East of Spuria and travelled to the Great Badger Expanse - the original destination of the ship

## Hadrian, the Disgruntled

Mixed in the pile of papers, is a document profiling "Hadrian the Disgruntled"

- North of Datrus, stands the Spire of Dizif, where a crazy wizard (Hadrian the Disgruntled) lives
- Hadrian is quite reclusive, but allegedly has a number of students from across the realm
- His motivations and intentions are shrouded in mystery
- Allegedly he studied at Nerwora, the Institute of the Arcane in Redlock
