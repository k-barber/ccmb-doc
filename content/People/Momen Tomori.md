##### Backstory
Momen grew up as a member of the Tomori clan, a dwarven clan well known for making high quality bells. However, not all members of a clan necessarily engage in the same occupation, and Momen instead followed his favourite grandfather as he studied the arcane. His grandfather, [[Fargrim Tomori]], specialized in the research of necromancy and was pursuing the secret of how to raise a dragon as an undead. After all, what better creature to defend the caves and treasures of the dwarves? Unfortunately, dragons, even when dead, prove to be incredibly resistant to magic. Fargrim passed away before he could see his research completed.

Momen gathered up his grandfather's research and enrolled in the [[Nerwora Institute of the Arcane]], eventually becoming a Professor of Applied Necromancy so that he could have the time and resources to further his studies. Eventually, all lines of inquiry ran into the same problem; acquiring specimens. Dragons are known to be difficult to find, and harder to kill.

For several years, Momen taught at Nerwora, struggling to figure out his next move. A stroke of luck appeared when news of the exploits of the [[Cedar Combe Monster Bashers]] arrived at Nerwora. They had apparently managed to slay a dragon. With that, his course of action was decided. He put his teaching on hold, and ventured out to find this band of dragon slayers.
