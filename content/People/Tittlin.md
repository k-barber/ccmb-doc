## Tittlin and Rittlin's Childhood

Tittlin real name is Tanyth Searo, and he has a brother [[Rittlin]] (Ryfon Searo) whom are the two bastard sons of the Royal Nyana Searo, and their father whom was killed early on in Tittlins life. Tittlin and Rittlin were taken to an orphanage when they were 10 and they hadnt heard from their mom since.

The orphanage that the Searo boys were left at were very abusive to the orphans, causing them to have a certain level of hate for the establishment. This led the boys to make an escape only a few years in. They exacted their revenge on the orphanage by blowing it up after getting all the other orphans out. This act as the beginning of their criminal way of life

Being on their own, they had to adapt as children, stealing from people in order to survive. This allowed them to develop their skills in thievery and criminal actions without getting caught. They would spend many years well into their adulthood doing this together as brothers.

After nearly 50 the boys got into an argument which led to them splitting up. The argument was rather silly and they lost contact of each other and styed separated for nearly a century.

## Tittlin and Pisces

Tittlin had a pretty basic story while on his own; he mainly turned to a life of thievery and met his only friend for many years along the way which ended up being his pet raven Pisces. Together they would steal stuff to survive, and live on the road always moving from town to town.

One day Pisces was taken from Tittlin, and using his criminal contacts he followed the bread crumbs to the [[The Great Badger Expanse]] where he met a group of adventures which would soon form the [[Cedar Combe Monster Bashers]]

Tittlin eventually caught a closer wind of where Pisces was being held shortly after joining the Monster Bashers where they had eventually found him and the two were finally reunited
