You approach the island. It is fairly small, but surrounded by massive boats.

In front of you is a large sandstone throne, on top of which sits a storm giant. He is tall. Very tall. You would guess that he is easily 30 feet. If he weren't sitting down, he would be taller than the trees around him. As it is, the top of his head brushes against the underside of the leaves.


- Speaks very slowly
- Has a giant weasel named mr. Noodle, that wraps itself around his shoulders
- Has a tendency to carefully lift humanoids (cradling their heads to avoid injury) to see and hear them better
- The giant is curious about minute details of fashion, slang, and popular culture among Humanoids.
- Has glasses that are much too small
