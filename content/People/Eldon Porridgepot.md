[[Merric Porridgepot]]'s father.

He currently resides in an urn under Merric's desk.

He was at one point the leader of [[The Quickfield Caravan]], although now he is dead.

During the [[Datrian-Torveldan War]] the caravan provided humanitarian relief under Eldon's leadership. This humanitarian aid earned him the title of "The Caravan King" and the ire of both [[The Kingdom of Torveldus]] and [[The Empire of Datrus]]. Datrus burned him at the stake, and his wife [[Jessamine Porridgepot]] was thrown in a Torveldan jail somewhere.

Merric doesn't think much of his father, because he never really knew him.
