Isabel Ⅱ was only six years old when the [[Datrian Civil War]] broke out. She was under the protection of her elder sister Clara and would often tag along as her sister attended strategy meetings. By age 10, Isabel was in combat training with the rest of the troops after harassing her sister's top general, Niclas Steyer, to let her train.

When Isabel was 14, it was clear that Carolin, the eldest sister, was winning the war. Lea was holding her own. Clara was clearly losing. Isabel asked to take control of the forces, since military strategy was not Clara's strong suit.

While Clara was tempted to let her sister take over, her generals refused. After the meeting, Niclas Steyer seemed to disappear, and three days later returned swearing fealty to Isabel.  

Allegedly one day he was walking past Isabel's tent when she grabbed him by the collar and had her way with him until he agreed she should lead the forces.

Isabel had her first child nine months later.

Under Isabel's leadership, the war completely changed direction. Over the next seven years she would lead a series of decisive victories, eventually defeating Carolin and Lea, and ending their bloodlines.

After the war, Isabel became the queen even though Clara was by birthright the next in line.

To thank Clara, Isabel offered her daughter's hand in marriage to Clara's son.

Clara did not object.

Under Isabel's leadership, Datrus expanded into what is now known as Wustus, Tunris Valley, Wrenttague, and Astain.
