King Alfred Ⅲ is a calm, caring man - an excellent foil to Aodreia's wrath. He is king-consort by way of his marriage to [[Empress Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ (668 – )|Empress Aodreia]], and Duke of [[The Imperial Plains|the Imperial Plains]] by his own rights. He was born in [[Tunris Valley]] to [[Konstantin Oberstein|Count Konstantin Oberstein]]

His personality often makes him the butt of emasculating jokes, but two things keep his status:

1. Despite his demeanor, he has had no challenge coaxing heirs out of the romantically disinclined Aodreia
2. Deep down most people know that anyone would look weak next to Aodreia

## Alfred's Relationship with Aodreia
He's been infatuated with Aodreia since he was a child, and is considered the only man alive with a chance in hell of continuing the royal line. In that regard, it seems his tenure has been quite successful.

He has sired 4 princes/princesses:

1. Isabel IV - the crown princess
2. Jacob
3. Philip
4. Florentine

Aodreia named their first child, Alfred named the other three.
