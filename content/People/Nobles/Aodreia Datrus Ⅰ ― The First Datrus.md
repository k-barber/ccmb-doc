A figure of legend and myth. Aodreia was the high priestess who united the peoples of the Imperial Plains, starting the Datrus Empire. It is said that she was blessed by the gods and could not be killed. She was both a powerful commander and expert diplomat.

She allegedly survived over 20 assassination attempts, and when she went to battle she lead the vanguard armed with nothing but a banner.

You have since learned that the god who blessed Aodreia was [[Aodreia â€• The Lord of Ice]], who bestowed his name upon her.

Before she was given the name Aodreia, she was called Melisenda. The people of Datrus celebrate the day she founded the queendom with a grand festival called [[The Feast of Lady Melisenda]], held for a week starting on the 23rd of [[Macnia]]. More traditional people still refer to her as "Our Lady Melisenda".
