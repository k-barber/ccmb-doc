[[Prince Nicholas Datrus (659 – )|Prince Nicholas']] eldest daughter. Much like her father, she is a ruthless opportunist. Eva and her sisters are the current [[Empress Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ (668 – )|Empress']] only first cousins - a position of much political power, but she lacks practical power to back it up. As such, she is actively hunting for a man of means (either wealth or man-power) to take as her husband.
