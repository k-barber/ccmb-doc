A Torveldan noble and diplomat. He was the guest of honour at [[Astor Brock]]'s party and someone tried to kill him.

That someone turned out to be [[Edgar Marquaad]]. 

After speaking to the Marquis, he revealed that Reinhardt is one of [[Hydrargyrum â€• The Quick|Hydrargyrum's]] servants, who is seeking to reignite the [[Datrian-Torveldan War]].
