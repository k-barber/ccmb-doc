King Alfred Ⅲ is a calm, caring man - an excellent foil to Aodreia's wrath. He is king-consort by way of his marriage to [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ]]. He is Duke of [[The Imperial Plains]] by his own rights though he was born in [[Tunris Valley]].

His personality often makes him the butt of emasculating jokes, but two things keep his status:

1. Despite his demeanor, he has had no challenge coaxing heirs out of the romantically disinclined Aodreia
2. Deep down most people know that anyone would look weak next to Aodreia

# Relationship with Aodreia
He's been infatuated with Aodreia since he was a child, and is considered the only man alive with a chance in hell of continuing the royal line. In that regard, it seems his tenure has been quite successful.

He has sired 4 princes/princesses:

1. [[Isabel Datrus IV]] - the crown princess
2. Jacob
3. Philip
4. Florentine

Aodreia named their first child, Alfred named the other three.
