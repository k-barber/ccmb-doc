A crypt beneath the palace in [[Elkenalden]]. It is managed by the royal family and contains the remains of many royals, as well as the remains of any who have lost in a state-sanctioned duel - so that they may not be resurrected.

It is the home of [[Aodreia â€• The Lord of Ice]], who keeps it at freezing temperatures both for his own sake and to preserve the bodies held within.
