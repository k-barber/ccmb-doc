Tittlin's log
The curse is lifted from spesof and oh boy does this guy have a lot of questions tht I simply dont care enough to answer. I do however out of the kindness of my heart and we press back to Momen at the lighthouse
We head back to see that momen had actually entirely cleaned up the place and got the bones ready for us to take back to the guy who wants it. Momen then hands me over the Blue Necklace which seems to be literally nothing but a glowing necklace
While momen prepares to put the bones on the boat it happens to start talking to him

The skeleton reanimates with the keeper's soul still attached to it. Momen is perplexed by this discovery and assures me that there is no magic involved but I am able to discover runes on the lighthouse crystal. looks like as long as the crystal is functional the keeper can stay living in the lighthouse
The keeper takes notes and we prepare to leave

The keeper signs a note to the quest giver in order to inform him what has happened and what the deal is going forward so we have some sort of evidnece to what played out 
While sleeping outside i get interrupted by a priest who seems to have an interest in me, or more, an interest in helping out people on their own

He speaks of a ship that thats been causing problems. Some people believe the ship to be from yggdrasil and believed to be frost giant pirates: The Cold Brawler
He is going to inquire about it and get back to me if there is a bounty in the morning

Spesof comes to find me and lets me know its time to go get his father
We talk to the captor and tell him what had happened with emeral and he is very suspicious so we show him the letter that had been written and then agreed that this was the best actions. He then goes and fetches spesof father who is perplexed that he was found.

We give the rundown on what spesof has been up to with his life and he seems taken bag but excited to see more
I head to the temple to see if the bounty has been built for the cold bralers and here was but it wasnt enough to warrent going to fight the frost giants
Spesof widdles a trinket for his dad in the shape of their old ship
Spesofs dad takes a look at the ship and then meets rittlin, where we then set sails and start heading back to cedercomb

We make it to knightfaire without any issues
With no issues in knightfaire we head back to cedarcomb
