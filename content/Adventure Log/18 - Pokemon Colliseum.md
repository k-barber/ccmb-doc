The party got drugged and fought in the Thieves Guild's colliseum.

Thirteen Spesof and Merric were asked to retrieve a bag from a place outside of town by a woman riding a horse. After accepting the msision the squad went out and found the location of the bag which was in a long building. The long stone room had armor statues and a pedistal where the bag lay. After inspecting the bag, the squad removed it from the bedistal which triggered the pressure plate releasing gas that put spesof and merric to sleep. Thirteen was shortly after restrained and bagged. THe squad woke up each in a separate arena cell where they were taked with fighting an initiation battle to prove there worth to their captors, the thieves guild. The thieves guild then explained that they take prisoner anyone whom tries to steal from them and they are sent into the battle arena where spectors place bets on a betting ring. The woman on the horse was identified as Baily (and chip the horse) hilsborne and are allies of the guild (along with titlin). THe squad then decided to fight the bear challenge in the arena where Thirteen almost met his demise and Spesof shrugged off attempts to be turned into a bear. Succeeding the battles the guilt looks forward to working with these fine warriors again soon.
