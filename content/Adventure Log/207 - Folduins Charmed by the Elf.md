Tittlin's Log!

Looking at the paper I had recieved there is a pattern of numbers from 1 to 4 and 4 columns with 1 button on each. It is assumed that we need to do the pillar buttons in the order of the combination which is 413421. Momen and I look at the columns to discover the order of the columns. We all press the buttons on the pillar in the right order and surely enough a corridor opens up on the right side of the room behind the throne.

Surely enough, [[Folduin Waesvaris]] was in the room. Spesof tries to tell him that we are only there for the Quintessence but he sees through spesof and assumes hes lying and wants to Kill him. He seems rather cautious about this and hovers his hand over an ominous button. Seeing this exchange going rather poorly I decide to step in and convince Folduin to hand over the Quintessence by charming him with the eyes of charming. He does so and we start to make our escape from the place. With that we head back to [[Helsinki]] to pick up [[Maknok Beegstick]]

In helsinki we talk to Maknok and he lets us know that he wants to stay with the family and maintain his land-legs for a few years before partaking in the sea life again

We head on out to the island where the giants were to return the Quintessence to them. At the island, Relsparraxe the Mighty was gracious to see that we have retrieved it safely and returned it. The Giant then rewarded us with a Belt of Storm Giant's Strength. Another brief and straightforward stop for the Monster Bashers, as we head off to the CCMB

Meanwhile back at the CCMB, Rittlin decks out his new found pet transportation with armor. Momen also studies his control crystals that require Succubus Blood, the control crustal, and something to do with an Ooze which should definitely get spesof excited (not). It would appear that each crystal allows  you to control 1 creature.
