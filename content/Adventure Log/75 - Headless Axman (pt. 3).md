- Met with the Countess' court mage, Zaghal, who provided the party a map in exchange for half an hour with Johanna
- Party went out to collect shards
- Any shards they didn't get the first time around because the people weren't convinced, they stole, or scared the owners with auditory illusions of an ax grinding on the stones
- Johanna used locate object to find any shards that may not have been on the map
- One in the temple
    - Managed to convince the priestess to let them into the crypts
- Â One in a noble's manor
    - Attempted to seduce the butler, but he did not budge
    - Tittlin snuck in using a potion of invisibility and haste
    - Found the lockbox that the shard was in, but failed to unlock it
    - Lockbox started ringing, so Tittlin shoved it in the bag of holding and booked it out of the house, just as the invisibility wore off
    - Butler saw Tittlin jump out the front door, so Tittlin used Eversmoking Bottle to escape
    - Spesof broke open the box
- Tittlin went alone to meet with the countess
- She recognized him and had his wanted poster, but did not care about any mischief he was causing in Stormcairn
- Tittlin attempted to get some of the cash upfront, but the countess didn't budge
- Party waited till night and handed the remaining shards to the Dullahan
    - Dullahan was glad to have his head back, and tossed the party some coin
    - Dullahan informed the party that the scar-faced man who raised him was a green dragon in disguise
- Party found a sick orphan in the slaver's hideout
