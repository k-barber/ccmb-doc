Tittlin's Log. We gather our stuff in the CCMB and reattune to our items before we head out to [[Spueria]], for the purpose of investigating another one of those circled locations on the map we found in [[Folduin Waesvaris|Folduin's]] office. 

We get into Spueria and it seems sort of like a homecoming for the Beegsticks, as some of the harbour workers recognize Spesof for his father, and well, his father for his father. Spesof gets the opportunity to let them know what had happened since he was last in town and the journey he has gone through to get back with [[Maknok Beegstick]].

Talking to the Harbor Master, he guides us to Folduins place and finishes up the conversation with the group. We also notice that 
Folduin's ship happens to also be in the water and I walk my way over to the ship and take a look. The ship is identical to the other one with a single guard on board. This boat looks like its got supplies on it that would suggest that it cam from the island directly before landing here. I went back to the land and told the rest of the party what I saw.

We then go and check out the house and it seems very obvious that this place is the real deal for Folduins personal home. There are tons of guards in place and the whole house looks a lot more cozy as well as protected. As far as I can tell, there isnt an easy way to get into this place.

Momen decides to treat us after our investigation (for some reason?) with a mansion inside a dimensional door and lets us relax. Spesof, Maknok, and i seem to get in an accidental drinking contest while Momen relaxes in a big comfy chair in the corner. We do manage to get a good nights rest and head back out to the house to reinvestigate, and the place seems much less guarded than when it was late at night

Momen remembers at an opportune time that he actually has the ring of x-ray vision and starts using that on the house to see if he can get a better idea of whats on the inside and more importantly, if he can find the Quintessence. Momen appears to see Folduin in the Dining room wearing the neckless, but couldnt identify whether he was illusory or not. There was however a locked room that Momen coudlnt see through that we would assume is another dragon loot room.

Spesof notices that one of the guards outside of Folduins place might actually be one of the crew members of the boat that Maknok and Spesof got stranded on. This gives us a plan to have Spesof and Maknok to distract the front door guard that they recognized while Momen and I sneak in while invisible. We execute the initial plan perfectly as expected, spesof distracted the front while momen and I sneak in. Momen guides me over to the dining room where Folduin sits. However one of the guards sstorms in and also reaches Folduin. He has a conversation with Folduin where the neckless lights up and he communicates with him. It would appear that Folduin is illusory in this case HOWEVER the neckless is not and is an actual neckless. Momen uses identify on the Neckless to figure out what it is which seems to be some sort of sending neckless for talking and stuff. It also seems to have Illusory Spell on it that seems to be a programmed illusion. This is how Folduin is able to be at many places at once and moving. After some discussion inside the home we have decided to do absolutely nothing with this information from inside the house and leave through the window, leaving everything inside untouched other than a few left behind bird food.

Spesof and Maknok have the lunch with the guard and dont illude him to anything suspicious. We believe that the lunch didnt help either of the parties out, he didnt get anything from us and we didnt get anything from him. In the aftermath we decide that we are going to meet up with Phillip Kallestad and ask him if theres anything hed like us to do.
