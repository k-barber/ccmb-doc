The [[Dire Troll|dire troll]] was infuriatingly hard to kill. Thoroughly bloodied and bruised, we continue onwards to [[Spesof Beegstick|Spesof's]] home town of [[Helsinki]]. Looking at him, it almost seems to be pulling him forwards, as the closer we get the faster he goes, until he's leaving us behind in a full on sprint.

We catch up with Spesof as the town comes into view. It's a rather small farming community, with a few larger longhouses near the center. [[Maknok Beegstick|Maknok]] leads us along to one of the smaller longhouses. As Spesof approaches the door, he hesitates before opening it. Inside are already four people. There's a moment of confusion, before the old man inside recognizes Maknok.

After a minute of surprised re-introductions, we're properly introduced to Spesof's aunt and uncle, [[Thislulo Beegstick|Thislulo]] and [[Kerghug Beegstick|Kerghug]] Beegstick and his cousins [[Wauktug Beegstick|Wauktug]] and [[Umphala Beegstick|Umphala]]. As we're introduced, a bowl and washcloth is brought out to help clean off after the dire troll. At the mention of the Monster Basher's and the Dire Troll, cousin Wauktug immediately lights up, asking all about monster hunting. His father though, does not look terribly impressed. It's not difficult to see why, as monster hunting is a dangerous profession. That being said, "If my cousin is doing it, why can't I?" is a hard argument to refute. Kerghug quickly shoots down [[Tittlin]]'s offer of going out on a hunt, wanting to know instead where Spesof and Maknok have been all these years.

Maknok and Spesof each take sometime talking about where they each washed up and what they got up to before re-uniting. As they start with the storm, we briefly get side-tracked into asking about [[Folduin Waesvaris|Folduin]] who, no surprise, hasn't been so much as heard from from in these parts. The stories continue, detailing Maknok's stranding, captivity and release. Spesof follows up, summarizing his washing up, finding his way to [[Cedar Combe]] and how he met [[Merric Porridgepot|Merric]] and joined the [[Cedar Combe Monster Bashers]].

Speaking over Wauktug's renewed monster questions, Kerghug asks Maknok if he'll become a merchant again. As Maknok's silent for a moment, I realize that it's not been long at all since he came back from his ordeal. He probably hasn't really thought about what comes next, having been focused for so long on just the next day. He eventually responds that he supposes he will, though without much enthusiasm, but he's unsure if he'd be able to get the money together for a new ship. Kerghug starts ribbing him about the loan for the first boat, which apparently came from their parents and was never repaid.

Spesof, with a hint of surprise in his voice says that he could provide the money for the loan. I suppose we all have gotten rather rich from the monster hunting. I can see Wauktug's coming to the same conclusion.
