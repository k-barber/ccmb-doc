Tittlins Log

[[Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ]] has stopped us to ask us what we plan to do with our services as if she is suspicious of our acts and abilities. Specifically she was curious about the motives of Spesof and I. Spesof talks about finding his place here where he can feel at home and talks about pursuing his father and I talk about my ambitions for wealth and rare objects.
She then continues to ask us about how we are as datrians and what our ties to the torveldans are. We voice that we really dont stand anywhere with the torveldans outside of doing the odd job here and there
Aodriea then tells us to STAY OUT OF THE BASEMENT, smiles and then lets us roam free

We roam around the building and find 2 points of interest, the Saunas, and the Library.
Momen makes his way into the library where he scours the index to see if there are spell books that he can learn something from
Spesof goes to the Sauna where he runs into [[Alfred Oberstein Ⅲ]] and notices a scar on his body, where he confirms that the scar came from Aodriea essentially stabbing him

Duke Oberstein then asks us for his favour in the Sauna. Specifically he wants us to deal with the Lord of Ice, which is the biggest threat to him having his wife all for himself. Taking on a dragon all on our own would be a big trouble. the Duke then brings fourth a plan he has to take out the Lord and shows us how we would fit into this plan as part of the favour we owe him.
He relays the plan to us and I am already on board but my party seems rather hesitant at the risks involved in the actions
Further boosting my wants here, The duke portraits a huge reward of the Lord of Ice's own stash of loot which I really want.
If we do this it would possibly create a power crisis in the Datrian/Torvelden realm but Oberstein states if we get [[Edgar Marquaad]] in power in [[Torveld]], the revolution would be set and would be enough of a distraction to cause to remain in control and not overrun by [[Hydrargyrum ― The Quick]]

We agree to do the job and all but momen shake hands to confirm the agreement with oberstein

We then head to dinner

Aodreia then reaises a glass at dinner and toasts to victory and datrius. Spesof looks like he is loving the dinner, trying to get a bite of everything possible. Aodriea then starts a conversation about politics and "restructuring". Starting by talking about Isabelle's hand in marriage and the play for [[Caspar Dorthana Ⅲ]] to be the best suitor. Aodriea wants to hand over control to [[Cedar Combe]] and Elkwood back to Baron Dorthana and have prince [[Nicholas Datrus]] Nick take over [[Stormcairn]]. The NEW Count Caspar would get promoted and become Duke of [[The Astain Wetlands]] which conflicts with [[Caylbaid ― The Quiet]] currently residing there -> we would have to deal with him by removing power from him, not necessarily killing him

Spesof then starts a conversation with the empress about what happened about duke getting stabbed by her, she seems humorously frustrated about it coming up but ran with the story anyways. Cliffnotes: she was queen and resently blessed so she needed to pick a husband - the first person to beat her in a duel would become her husband, Alfred ended up being a sort of coach to her and she found herself looking to him for advice after every win. Once she was 18 he challenged her to a duel for marriage. during the challenge she struck his shield in order to disarm him and end the battle quick, the blade went through what she found out too late to be an illusory shield and pierced alfred. In doing so she dropped her sword in shock and alfred claimed that she was disarmed, with the sword still in him. Alfred then was declared husband on the spot. Alfred had died during the aftermath. During the funeral, a bright pink light escaped the coffin when aodriea dropped to her knees when seeing alfred for the last time and the story stopped there - it is assumed the Aphrodite had brought him back in the name of love.
I then ask how they met and the Duke responds that he would tell us outside of the Empress's presence

The empress then brings up our plans for the teleportation hub routes and where we got it from, she seems to be hoping we could create this movement route in order to help move troops quickly.

After the dinner spesof asks about being able to potentially upgrade the circlet of blasting and afterwards we all head on up to the library to do some research

We go to bed and wait for the next day
Spesof is told he could get meteorite and incorporate it into the circlet of blasting in order to somewhat significantly improve it
