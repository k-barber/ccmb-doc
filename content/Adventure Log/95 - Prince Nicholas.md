- Prince Nicholas came to town, and wanted to meet with the CCMB
- He asked the party about what Caylbaid wanted
    - Party answered honestly - that Caylbaid requested a portrait from the Datrian Royal palace
    - Nicholas said he wasn't opposed
        - doing so would make his niece look bad
        - would improve his daughter's (Sofia) chance of becoming favored by Aodreia
        - If the party decided to steal the painting, Nicholas would assist
        - Cautioned that the party should meet his niece before deciding one way or the other
- Â Entreated the party to retrieve a relic "Gabriella's swaddling cloth" from the Teleportation Dungeon, a world-famous dungeon to the North-West of the Lunenkasing Woodland
    - "Gabriella Datrus was the 7th Queen of Datrus, known as the "Miracle Queen" because of her immense luck. Her mother, Queen Josephine, was in a carriage accident while she was pregnant. The shock forced her majesty into labor, and Gabriella was born 2 months premature - but she survived. The reason for this is simple:  
        The swaddling cloth around Gabriella was a divine artifact.  
        I'd like it back.  
        If you'd like my help in defeating the goblins, retrieve it for me.  
        Gabriella's husband was a royal knight who's name has since been lost to history. One day he decided to challenge the Teleportation Dungeon, and Gabriella gave it to her husband as a good luck charm. Her husband set out at the start of the year 156. 5 months later Gabriella's only daughter died of purple fever. 10 months later her granddaughter died in childbirth. On the last day of the year, a group of adventurers emerged from the dungeon, carrying her husband's breastplate. Allegedly Gabriella died the moment the sun touched that breastplate. I guess her luck ran out."
    - "I'm well aware of the reputation I have as an incompetent coward, but our family tree is filled with courageous corpses. I have three young daughters that I'd like to see married before I go diving into any unwinnable fights."
- Goras remembered that Gabriella's husband was a royal knight named Ealdwig
    
    - Goras had advised him not to attempt to conquer the dungeon
