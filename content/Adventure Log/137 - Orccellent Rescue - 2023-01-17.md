Adventure Log, Some Time, Some Day  
We spend the afternoon resting up and preparing to interrogate the goblin  
turns out the rat fuck can speak common  
Turns out they may have taken spesof to "a bunch of rocks surrounded by water" not really what we want to hear, not very helpful  
This goblin literally knows nothing about this place, hes never been, doesnt know where it is, doesnt know how far away it is.  
I have come up with the genius idea to scout the shoreline on foot while meric and momen fly around on the broom stick   
but first we rest  
We get up and make our way to the water  
We do easily find the goblin base off shore as its blazingly lit up for us to find. Seems nice, we cozy on up in the north-eastern corner that is unlit so we can think of what to do  
Merric, cant see for the life of him which is unfortunate but i assume we are going to scout the area in search of spesof  
I do a Reversed-C Shaped lap around the base and find where all the external bug bears are and where the Hydra is located locked in a double doored cage.  
Momen uses his Locate Creature spell to identify where spesof was  
Momen decides to fallow his feelings as i guide him through the the base of floating houses  
As we come up to one of the houses, on the other side a door opens and a hob goblin comes and and walks out to the deck on top of the hydra cage and as that happens another southern door opens and a bunch of enemies walk out and seemingly move into the building [[Merric Porridgepot]] and momen are beside  
We work our way around to spesof's building and upon realising i would have to silently kill the bug bear I then realized i didnt have a bow, so Merric pulls out a bow string and im able to re make my bow and NOW i am ready to kill

I take the shot and BARELY make the kill when Momen comes in clutch and grabs the body  
immediately afterwards we hear a hobgoblin make its way up to the building we are located at and the second it goes and start to scream where i imediately shoot and kill it, where it then falls into the water and wakes up the hydra  
the hydra then wakes up every one  
goblins then storm the area around the area in hopes to calm it down (?)  
As a navy seal hops onto the back of the hydra i take a shot at it and kill it instantaneously  
which in turn starts a scrum, the goblins scream for assistance  
I move over to the gate to check on it to see if it has been opened yet (spoiler alert, it wasnt open yet) and then ready a shot on a goblin target in the case the allies plan on breaching through the door to the exterior  
To my surprise, a BUGBEAR Breaches the door knocking a goblin into tthe water, seeing that the hydra is under control now, I shot the goblin in air to make sure it died and didnt have the ability to open the gate  
The Hydra then becomes enraged when it sees that its rider is no longer alive, the navy seal one and kills the goblin on top of it as well as many other goblins around it. also taking a bite out of momen at the same time, leaving some unwanted damage  
Suddenly, the Hydra turns into a fish, thanks merric, and the goblin that was on it falls into the water  
I then steady a shot all the way to the goblin devastator doing MASSIVE ammounts of damage to it weakening it heavily, all while a volley of arrows hit me but because im in the water most of them ended up missing. Momen then points at it and finishes off the devastator with a devastating blow  
Merric gets hit in the back where then IMMEDIATELY THE HYDRA GROWS RIGHT UNDER NEATH MOMEN  
Momen then becomes the rider of the hydra and the General hucks some spears at him where Momen's shield does manage to block it all thankfully  
Okay, now there is a sprawl happening ON TOP of the hydra and merric just hypnotic patterned almost all of the enemies all at once  
I see Momen strugglign with that hobgoblin so i move around the building for cover and execute him to give momen some space to maneuver  
Momen then unleashes a GIANT snowball on the whole area making the entire base cold and killing every goblin in sight  
In terror I watch as the Hydro regrows one of its heads randomly  
A bug bear sneaks its way up onto the hydra and tries to wrestle contorl of it RIGTH beside momen, this is an odd sight to see  
Seeing this bug bear, I take him out as quickly  as possible to provide momen some cover. Then sneak my way into the room to find a Magical Trophy (Use TBD) and stash it in my bag for later thanks to the magic detection of merric  
All I hear while within this building is a bunch of bings and bongs and the hydra screaming. Doesnt sound good. I hope Momen and Spesof are okay   
Merric yells at me again telling me that there was another magical item somewhere in another room so I bolt over to try and find it  
Momen seems to have gotten the boat ready to go? he wants to broomin around with it tied to the boat  
THe general then yells something out, Probably to the hydra, and the hydra roars and turns around to potentially attack us  
Hearing where spesof's stuff is, I go invisible and make my way over there  
Out in the distance I can hear a scream from spesof, I hop he is okay!  
I see the General Covering the door where I would need to get the items for spesof, so instead I break away from my invisibility and shoot at him, not doing very much damage sadly. then move back into cover  
I can hear the hydra raging on the animated door than Momen conjured up and completely destroys it  
Merric somehow talks the general into thinking that the bag of stuff was a bomb and he tosses it, where merric then flies away with it while I bolt in the other direction  
We devise a plan to get out. Momen is going to cast levitate on one of the party members while meric flies himself and another on the broom out. And your good ol pal Tittlin will run it on foot.  
We meet up all together at the shoreline in a tiny hut that momen had conjured up
