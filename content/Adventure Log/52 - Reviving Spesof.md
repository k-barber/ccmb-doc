- 5-0-13 and Tittlin travelled to Elkenalden to revive Spesof
- Met Captain Penelope - Human woman, 28 years old
- Met Friar Zeckus, a dwarf man of few words who had to be convinced to help Spesof because Tittlin's alignment wasn't good
- Zeckus sensed that Spesof had been blessed by Sashelas and so chose to pray to a complimentary god: Aphrodite
- 5-0-13 fetched some perfume and flowers to appease Aphrodite
- Spesof was revived and the party returned home and let him rest
