Tittlin's Log, Who knows when, in the wedding

Some girl and her older brother joined the party, I have NO idea who they are but they definitely werent invited?  Not on any of my Cue Cards at least. Spesof suggests that we go and talk to [[Felicia Dorthana]] about this. Felicia is really grumpy about the whole thing, apparently the older brother is out to kill Felicia and [[Aaron Dorthana]]. The idea is that they are there in order to duel Aaron to the death.

Next, the Wustus Crew Ebbesens shows up, with the Archduke, Kristen, and [[Marcus Ebbesen]] Marcus. We walk up to Kristen and shes unbearable to talk to, hard to get all the way through this conversation with her tone of voice. Kristen however identifies she loves paying for things and ends up paying me upfront to get marcus to marry into someone in the GBE.

We then go and talk to marcus, where he seems to be a little empty headed and he goes on talking about the economy. He is also interested in the culture of everything. We try and narrow down who we may be able to set him up with. Under no circumstances is he allowed to get with Katya.
We go talk to Eva and she seems slightly upset by the fact that the Strasburg Brothers completely ignored her while oogling over Scarlette. Eva likes the idea of getting with Marcus but has some conflicts with it at first that needs to be settled with first.

We pull over [[Phillip Dorthana]] and get the juicy gossip from him that he gathered from talking to the Wyrmwoods, Yosefina seems to be interested in marrying into high status and deep pockets more, particular someone like Dick. 
I then go over to make sure Katya and Rian dont reveal any information about the greenteeth coven to Dick.

Archduke Ebbesen then summons us over to talk about the assassination attempts towards Count Dorthana, and provide him with the word for word cover story on what went down.  He then inquires with us about our relationship with the Duke and we explain that we have been too busy with monster bashing. He then extends an invitation to be a part of his faction in Wustus. He offered reasons for us to join to everyone BUT spesof, so we are convinced he is a racist

OMG, Its [[Caylbaid ― The Quiet]]'s Lover! Get her some Mimosas. She comes and directly greets us before moving off to talk to others.

We then go and talk to Katya and Rian to see if they have had the chance to talk to Angelina, but her grandfather seems to be negative against guys going and talking to her. Phillip likes trees.
We then hang around and listen in on other peoples conversations, specifically the the Strasburgs who think a war should be started to siege torveldus again

Fabian Schwarzmann then goes straight up to the balcony and Eva follows him to try and seduce him. I listen upon them and notice that Eva is absolutely HORRIBLE at doing so and eventually gives up and leaves
We then go and talk to Duke Agnar again and see if had more information on Spuria stuff. Spesof then reads one of the fairy tails about love and the Duke seemed to really appreciate this

The Duke then goes on to why he both lieks and dislikes Dick. We specifically have interest in that railtech information.
[[Alfred Oberstein Ⅲ]] then shows up and then out of surprise Isabel shows up with him as well. IN WHICH, [[Caspar Dorthana Ⅲ]] then gets invited as well and the STARS... ALIGN!

Some speeches are made and the objections are about to begin. [[Sebastian Eichenwald]] then steps forward and objects, somewhat routinely, to honour his family, expecting this duel to go without death. Count Dorthana wins this battle easily and no blood was shed. The Weis brother then objects and they get ready to duel. They both bring magical weapons to the duel and its rather riveting. After a prolonged battle, Aaron sees victorious.
