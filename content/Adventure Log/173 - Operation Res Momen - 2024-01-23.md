Tittlin's log

I woke up to find myself laying in front of Spesof Beegstick and a pile of dust
It would appear that Momen Tomori has been spesof'd

As we try to leave the room where the beholder, we can hear grinding in the wall where a room has opened up. Inside was a broken glass case assumed to have been holding some sort of rusty blade. THeres a random chair and table setup along with a crystal ball so whomever was in here could talk to the dead. On the table is a notebook which spesof takes a gander at. The book looks like its 600 years old ish written by someone named Isabelle. I take the expensive suff in the room which looks like like jewelery box and a cool book.
Spesof tries to open the sarcophagus and takes cold damage for whatever reason
We decide to call up  Rafnar Jacobson and have him teleport us to the capital so that we could revive Momen
We immediately take Momen to the Cathedral of Rejuvination upon our arrival
turns out we need a diamond worth 2500pp

We try to bargain with the friar as the total cost will be 7500pp service which we do not have
I pull out the book that I stole and start reading. I begin reading through the book and I can tell that it is VERY old and clearly written by someone in the datrian imperial family shortly after the first aiodria. Details a lot of information about the lord of ice and i Can feel my fingertips go numb. This goes in details about the lord of ice
[[Alfred Oberstein Ⅲ]] bursts into the church

He detected strong arcane magic in the church and wanted to make sure the friar wasnt casting anything unusal of the sorts

Spesof and I take a walk out of the church in order to discuss our plan
We continued discussing and came to the conclusion that we were going to go to alfred with the book and use it as a token of trust in hopes that he will help us in getting momen revived.

We go to the palace where the queen appears to be absent, we talk to one of the guards who then proceeds to take us to the duke.
Spesof leads the conversation where the duke says his "Sauna time" is at 2 so we are going to hang around until then
We sit down and have a meal with the family and keep to small talk until the time passed by to have the conversation

We head out to the gardens and wait

Spesof breathes in the magical flowers and begin to levitate - Seeing this i immediately breathe it in a couple of times and get numerous effects - Quick wittedness  - Butterfly illusions - grease below me - I get the sense that I am invincible. And on my last snif - I feel like magic is coarsing through my body and it cant be contained and my body triplicates and i start dancing with my 3 illusory copies of myself. I can feel the magic overflowing again and all of a sudden 2 things just oozed out of me.  I try to get in tourch with them and they seem to be very upset with me and dont want anything to do with me and then proceed to throw up on me. As I dodge the puke I grow really big and I dont really know whats going on too much. I start to breakdance to see what will happen and then I get very confused. Spesof goes inside to see what can be done about the magic and apparently i need to go to the bathhouse. I feel the magic coming on again and all of a sudden ... (turns into a potted plant) 

Spesof put my into the baths and I return to my normal self except I am now blue
The duke comes along and removes the blue curse from me

Spesof speaks to the Duke of that how Momen was killed. We go over the book and what was in it. the duke with curiosity whips out a anti magic barrier in order to look over the book. He inquires abotu where we had gotten this book in which we explain where we got it from. Apparently the sword was owned by Isabelle the 2nd and the fact that her sword was stolen from the place was rather unfortunate because it was important to get back and was stolen by someone else.
We plead that we wouldnt have been able to get our hands on the book in the first place without momens efforts and he then channels some magic to have momen recreated and revived infront of our own very eyes
We then take out the journal that spesof had stolen which happened to be [[Isabel Datrus Ⅱ ― Child Conqueror]]'s journal
The crypt is assumed to be Isabelle's Husband

The duke had interest in the name we brought up "Eornthryth Touchet", supposedly that man being in the Dukes basement. The running theory is that Isabelle is burried in the Dukes basmenent instead and its been a duzy mix up
We finish up the conversation with the duke
