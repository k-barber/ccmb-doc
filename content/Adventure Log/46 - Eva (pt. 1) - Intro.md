- The party met [[Eva]], a recent orphan girl that spontaneously created fireballs whenever she fell asleep.
- The town was calling for her execution, when [[Astor Brock]] pawned her off onto the Monster Bashers
- The party took her to the now empty Wyvern cave in an attempt to protect her while she slept.
- Learned she could see into the Ethereal plane after the party caught her staring at the phase spider remains on Spesof's jacket
- Went to the graveyard to enter the Ethereal, and fought a night hag - who grabbed Eva and disappeared to another plane
