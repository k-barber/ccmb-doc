I take a walk over to the northwest of [[Yertleswade]] and notice that the pond isnt actually a pond and it is infact a Hot Spring. Momen heads on back to the Library of the Lifegiver to try and query on whether or not spell books can be replicated too.

While Momen does his work with the spell book, Spesof and I work on trying to get the boat portage the boat down to [[Tumblebar]] taking us about 2 hours to get to the river connected to it and another hour to get to Tymblebar itself. 

Upon arriving to Tumblebar, it appears that the place is relatively roughhoused, the citizens look like theyve gone through a lot and I notice that people have typically bean beaten and abused by monsters along the way. We gather some information on the town and we believe it is governed by [[Baron Evindal Kaindadar]] and that he is quite impulsive. Kaindadar doesn't seem to be the clever type according to [[Caspar Dorthana â…¢]]. Momen looks around and takes a notice that MOST of the town seems to be ravaged by monsters including almost every Man, Woman, and Children. I notice that Momen still has his Dragon was just out and about and spooking the locals. At this moment Momen makes an effort to throw the Dragon (which I call Theodore), into the hidden door room.

A Gnomish woman wearing a butchers apron comes around and looks at Spesof and inquires about monster parts. Spesof responds with wanting to finish up with his "meeting" with the Baron before getting into business with any of the locals. Eventually he cracks and offers to let her take a look at the Death Kiss parts that Spesof has, offering over 400gp per part. The woman then informs us that the Baron wouldnt really care much for gifts and that hes more of a "see it to believe it" kind of man. Given this information Spesof decides to sell them to the woman.

Momen sends me out on a criminal goose chase to find out more information on why the town is the way it is with the people so banged up, and more information on the Baron. The people seem to be fairly proud of their Monster Hunting etiquette, its less as if they were damaged by it but strengthened by the fact that most of the town is monster hunters. As for the Baron, the people from the town for the most part seem to talk about the Baron as if he as a kinds and generous person which contradicts in a way what the Woman and Caspar had said. After arguing our point between eachother on how we resolve the issue with the Baron, we decide to just go in and ask him what he wants.

We head into the Main Hall, a relatively open space with a head table where an old Half Elf man sat, who is the Baron himself. We get into a bicker about my weight (laughs). We eventually pitch what we are proposing in terms of Caspars Ascension and let Spesof do the talking but that doesnt do it for the Baron, he steps in and says he needs him to get to the point. We discuss it and the Baron decides he needs to see Caspar in action before he can back him. He also talks about how Tumblebar isnt a thriving town. Due to circumstances, Tumblebar lost its path to proper trade and they want a way around that. He's looking for as Spesof says, Diggers, in order to extend the river to create a path.

We ask Caspar if he's equipped to take down a [[Troll]] and he seems quite hesitant. We pitch ideas in order to make this easier. Caspar ensures he's up for the task but might not be exactly equipped to to take down a troll on his own as it would be a rather difficult task for even the most experienced hunter on their own. We gave Caspar the following:
* The Two Rapiers of Wounding
* The Diadem of Meteors
*  The Vampiric Bloodstone
* A vial of Acid
* Potions of Healing
* Potions of Greater Healing

We pass the time until the battle begins. We head off to find the troll and sure enough we do quicky given that the Baron knew exactly where it is. I climb up a tree and get a good view of the fight where it begins.

... Momen will take over from here.
