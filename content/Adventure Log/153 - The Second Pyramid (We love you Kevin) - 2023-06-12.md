Tittlin's Log
Seeing Momen go down, spesof and I head into a rage against the medusa taking it out swiftly before heading into the infinite hallway and attempt to short rest. Our short rest appears to be doing nothing though as we cant gain any of our life back. Momen though does wake up after about an hour

We then had myself check the exits for enemies and YES they are all there in numbers and would rather not go through that all, so momen then decides to focus hard on pass wall and get us out the rear of the pyramids. This is successful and we head on home.

(session break)

We then plan a way to get our curses removed and make [[Elderlot]] our destination of choice. Horace in his part removes the curse from us and asks a couple of questions.

We then prepare for our next encounter with the other mummy lord.
We leave for the pyramids and when we arrive, We walk up to the tents behind the green Pyramid. Spesof, walks up to the mummy general and tries to convince the general to let us take audience with the Green Mummy Lord

Surprisingly this works flawlessly and we head on our way into the pyramid
We step into the pyramid and this one is DEFINITELY more creepy than the other one just as the guards at the front said. In the room to our left there is a taxidermi Dog thingy, and on the right there is a taxidermi Chimera

We decide to take the right path and press forward into a room where a stuffed minataur with a soldier in it. The soldier seemed petrified of the place cowering in fear
I walk further into the room and immediately get clawed out of nowhere and grappled into the room. Spesof then comes to save the day as he rushes in to help with in my conundrum.

The boneclaw then tries to attack momen as he approaches and misses, then moves towards me and tries swiping at both spesof and I, missing both
The guy is a wizard who tried to turn himself into a lych and ended up becoming an undead instead. Momen makes these remarks outloud calling him a dumbass essentially and the Boneclaw "Kevin" seems fairly annoyed about this

The boneclaw then disappears into a shadowy goo and explodes his goo all over momen, dealing a surprising amount of damage
Momen senses strong necrotic presences in north and the south and we decided to the south one as it felt more promising to be the mummy lord

We start a conversation with the mummy lord and try to convince her that she belongs in another dimension where she would have an advantage over the stupid dumb mummy lord

We then leave to go research in the library and come back with more information. We come back with Nessus, one of the Nine Hells - and project this information to the lord. I absolutely BUTCHER all attempts to convince the lord and we stand there in an awkward science
She does not know where Kevin is
Dog
Off
Leash
I manage to intimidate the Lord however by telling her she had to either leave or fight us, and the other mummy lord couldnt handle us and had to flea. Seeing how they were relatively equal combatants, the odds were not on her side. She then uses momen to help conjur a spell to make this process happen

ITS KEVIN! HE CAME TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
We are informed that we need to leave immediately
Spesof finds a loot room last minute and we haul as much as possible out of it
We then check the chest to see what is in it but momen informs us that there is a Glyph of Warding on it and the chest will deal acid if triggered
We open the chets properly and inside we find a suit of scalemale armor

We decide to give this armor to Spesof
