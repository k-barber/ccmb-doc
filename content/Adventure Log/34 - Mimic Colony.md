- Party was heading to [[Knight Faire]], and stopped at a strange town along the way.
- The people of the town seemed quite hungry and were very bad conversationalists
- Spesof picked up a sword from the salesman, and the party went on their way
- Met a group of imperial soldiers who were looking for a mimic colony - told them about the strange town
- Went to Knight Faire and met with the viscount, who told Spesof that he had documents relating to his father's disappearance, and would hand them over, if the CCMB broke the Viscount's deal with a coven of hags
- Passing through the town again, the party realized the soldiers had been eaten, so they confronted the barkeep - the only man who seemed able to talk
- Confirmed that the town was a mimic colony, and told them about the goblins nearby which would make a much better food source
- The barkeep (flamemouth) taught Spesof how to use the Fraudsword
