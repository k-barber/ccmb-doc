- Party travelled to Suurra, the town outside the Teleportation Dungeon
- Tittlin got a quote for a grave - just in case
- Met a Retriever, who sketched identifying marks on adventurers
    - gave some tips for the dungeon
        - Red teleporters are random - if someone steps on one, don't followÂ 
        - Purple teleporters are one-way or two-way - always go to the same spot
        - The path deeper is all two-way teleporters
- The townspeople seemed tired and listless - a result of the "Curse of the Dungeon"
    - Only the grave keeper and the Retriever were unaffected
    - 5-0-13 figured out that the breastplate on Ealdwig's statue was enchanted - and that the Retriever had sketched down the runes
        - purchased a copy
- Dove into the dungeon
- Spesof got teleported
    - Blew his signal whistle
    - Tittlin drank his potion of Cloud giant strength and is attempting to break down the wall
