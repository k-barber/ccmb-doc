Tittlin's log

We decide that after all of the upgades that we should just head back to [[Cedar Combe]]. On our way we stop in Knightfair and the situation seems rather tense
Spesof asks the guard about the issues and he shys away. Apparently there is a politcal issue
Talking to my criminal contact there is an issue with the Viscount of Knighfare and his Daughter, the wirmwoods

It is suspected that this might be what aphrodite wants me to get involved in considering it is about katya
We head back to cedercomb in the mean time and in the process check in on the fief

Waiting in the Monster Bashers was an Imperial Guard whom hands us back the immovable rod
[[Merric Porridgepot]] informs us that Imaginary Spider Boy had stopped by the bashers and had posted up in his own teensie fort to the south

Spesof Beegstick decides if we are going to be fighting some invisi-spiders hes gonna wear the robe of eyes so he can see them better
We head our way into the fort and I decide to send my brother Rittlin instead of me
Ill be taking notes along the way still though
They get into the fort and theres a sleeping elf on a horse - we assume this to be the man who called us about the spiders

Spesof and Momen Tomori grill the elf on the setup of the fort and the information on the mechanical spiders
The party is allowed to camp out in the fort as they wait for the spiders
The spiders always try to pursue Gilmethel and that they are specifically interested in him and not anything that he has in his cargo
Rittlin looks through his clothes and nothing seems out of the ordinary although he has a spider necklace around him

They take the necklace and take it for safe keepings in hopes that the spiders are attracted to that and not him
We notice that there is a small rune etched on the ruby in the spider
Using a jewelers magifying glass - momen can see the rune a little better and can see its some sort of enchantment rune
It would appear the jewel has been replaced by someone out to get him. He got it replaced in a port in [[The Kingdom of Torveldus]] and its likely that this has been enchanted to have him killed

Momen and rittlin get in a conversation about the repeated use of spiders in everything considering he has an enchanted dagger with a spider on it
Rittlin then talks about how hes had recent stomach aches and that he might need momens help with somethig considering it feels to be related to being a phantom
they head out to the field and await the spiders

According to spesof, there are spiders approaching from the north a few hours after they wait
It gets closer but rittlin nor momen can see it
They try Auspicious Lens on it and with momen it didnt work but when spesof tried it it worked and the spider became aware - getting up and causing a stir

Spesof walks forward and drops the necklace on the ground and steps away
The spider then walks up to it and sits on it
Momen also steps up and borrows the robe and and starts drawing but hes not very good at it. Thats when rittlin comes in and draws a solid base for the spider and moment will continue with the details
Spesof then tries to continue lensing it
The spider is unhappy with this and gets up to attack spesof

They then set up fight on the spider 
Momen places tentacles underneath the spider but the spiders seems a little quick and nimbly dodges the effect
Rittlin lets out a huge fart that I could hear from a couple hundred feet away which then turns him into a ghost? he starts flying around and flanks the spider, cutting it with his sword 
Spesof then attacks the spider with a whole bunch of shifty attacks which seem to do quite a bit of damage, but the spider then immediately retaliates on him - THank god he is a tank sort of

Momen makes another tempt to magically effect the spider but fails another time with an arm coming out of the ground - This spider seems relatively strong
The spider turns around attack rittlin and misses with its beam - realizing it was being outclassed it returns to the ether
momen tries striking it but spesof notices that the attack goes right through the spider and doesnt effect it

This continues to be the case for all the members - nothing seems to hit them
The spider ran away with the neckless supposedly
They head back to the fort to give the news to Gilmithel
HE rewards us
with stuff
