Not sure whats going on here
But [[Caylbaid ― The Quiet]] just blew up [[Nicholas Datrus]] and all of a suddenly [[Aodreia Datrus Ⅲ]] and Nick rise from the grave and her shield is looking at me? Then she summons a bunch of words and gets everyone cheered up
Aiodria and Caylbaid seem to be dooking it out 400 feet in the air

The units all keep holding their ground as Momen and his Infintry/Mages xome up to cover the south.  The goblins continue pressing forward

Spesofs newly acquired Worm is seriously putting in damage where its needed
The count has requested that we go on a mission to take out those blasted siege weapons so it seems I am leaving my troops in order to do so. a SPEC OPS Mission if you will

I head of on said mission while my compadres operate on their own fairy well 
is time presses forward we slowly weed the goblin army away

[[Merric Porridgepot]] Momen and Spesof then find a way across the River so that they can deal with the Siege Weapons, Momen in particular taking out one already right away!
I make my way across the river to help out the Bashers with their Bashing

We keep pressure on the Siege weapons, taking another one down with one left to go. THe remaining major issues are the Heavy Infantry and [[Giemrayt ― The Gentle]]
Caylbaid and Aiodria meanwhile are still in their little Hissy Fit in the sky
