Party entered a temple, toÂ  Retrieve Art from a dungeon.

Black pudding had hurt a man - Spesof went to investigate and got glomped

Went north through the flooded store-room and came face to face with a water elemental

Party surprised the water elemental and nearly killed it, but it then whelmed 5-0-13 and reached the flooded sections, quickly gaining speed and running off with Tittlin

Spesof performed a ritual at the altar and received Sashelas' blessing

After defeating the water elemental, the party found a storeroom, filled with goblins, which surprised the party, and nearly wiped them out
