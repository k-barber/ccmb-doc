- Enjoyed the festival:Â 
    - Merric chugged sausage
    - Tittlin rube-goldberged an expensive (15 cp) mask
- Watched some executions and heckled
- Caught the bouquet (rope) and keel-hauled the bandit captain from the sewers
- Bandit captain came back as a ghost, so Merric put up a sign and we ignored it
- Ethereal spiders came to kill us
- Merric baited a spider by lying down with a sausage ontop of him before slut-shaming it to death
- Tittlin found the path to the Ethereal plane, we went and killed them all
