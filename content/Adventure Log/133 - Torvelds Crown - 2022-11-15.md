Captains Log, I have done it  
I have defeated the mage and done it in IMPECABLE Fashion

Now there is a slight issue where momen is down and spesof well, i managed to get Spesof up so he can help me haul the professor back to town. Thank god I didnt have to do this myself, I couldnt handle both of these people. Spesof and I head back to ton with momen in toe, and it takes a little longer, I think spesof really knocked his head in that battle.  
Back at the boat, it seems the townsmen have flailed tons of eggs at the boat and that upsets me greatly, this dog is my life now. I have decided to name the dog Steve French. Steve French will be the best boy ever seen. Spesof and moment go back to the motel and I chill with Steve French and sleep it off in the boat. I wake up to see that Steve French is still sleeping, what a cute doggy.

We then plan our return to cedercomb with a quick stop to farquad to make sure he gets what [[Hydrargyrum ― The Quick]] gave us. We change our mind and decide to head back to cedercomb instead, we dont want to be meeting up with farquad more than we have to so we are just going to come back when we have everything he wants.

We head back to [[Cedar Combe]] and [[Merric Porridgepot]] and [[Goras Kelrieth]] (Bald Eagle) give me the hear breaking news that it is going to be very hard to tame the beast so this is going to take quite some time

I come up with a plan to go to [[Qymera ― The Puny]] the dragon from yonder and see if he can help guide me to train the drake to be an ally. In the mean time we prepare all sorts of other stuff like moms information and spesofs homework

We get a long rest and plan for our journey to Qymera and afterwards to Farquad

Momen before we leave came to me and asked me for assistance with conjuring up some dead. Insead of me just going out and killing people, I decided to give the good ol [[Thieves Guild]] Arena a shot. At the arena the receptionist informed us that there is a fresh owl bear killed and decomposed that momen can raise. Im not sure if he will be able to raise it but it seems like he is going to try. By God He Did It!

We pay for some rowers for the boat so we dont have to do most of the work  
and we head off at sea to our first stop the Qymera

Qymera informs us that Dragons are racist and that the Blue Steve French is most likely a Red Drake  
Also that there is nothing to do that he can help with in terms of training other than giving us a list of simple draconic commands I can use that the dragon will understand. Spesof asks if there are any wyrmlings around that we can killl. He informs us that there are a pair of Wyrmlings in the eastern march and in tunrys valley which is just north of the imperial plains. We get to farquad at the end of our trip and hand him the piece of the artifact 
Farquad doesnt seem happy with us considering we didnt kill [[Geoff Reinhardt]]. Farquad is very skeptical about the fact that Hydragerum gave us the artifact for no reason lol. Farquad gives us all these questions about hydrargerum and seems very happy about all of this im not sure why. Momen writes down all of the information that Farquad gives us of Hydragerum and the history of Torveldus. Farquad informs us that the only way to truly unite Torveldus and Datrius is to Destroy the crown from within Hydrargerum
