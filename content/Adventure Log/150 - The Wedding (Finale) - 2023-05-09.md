We mingle for the rest of the party and split off to our own people to gain some relationships with people. I with  Rian Wyrmwood, Momen with [[Alfred Oberstein Ⅲ]], and Spesof with the Guards. And Momen is able to get information from Oberstein

We then as a party go up to Fabian and Angelina to congratulate them and have a hopes of having a conversation with Fabian about the Warmongering. 
Fabian doesnt support either of the boys for the Arch Duchee and doesnt want to throw his hat into the ring on the matter yet.

We then talk to fabian about information we can use to settle the stuff with the Strasburg boys and he ends up giving us a binder of information. We then ask Angelina about Ebbssen backing Samuel and she has no opinions on the matter at all
Spesof then talks to her about her Wustussian Stuff and she hands over a journal about her abduction story.
Red Swan is stationed at the star in or something like that. This is a book that lists the spies and their operations. Spesof salivates at the thought of it all. The book includes hundreds of spies and all the information needed to sought them out

Kristin and then Dick enter the room and announce that they are engaged. Took him long enough. Everyone seems pleased that the two of them are locked up and not a romantic danger to the rest of the people. Ebbesen supports it and wants them to be in Wustus, where as Oberstein wants them to be in Datrus. They looked stunned at the fact that they needed to figure this out before hand. They announce that they havent decided yet and leave it at that 
Then the party transitions to food and then a ball, then the ceremony
Noticing that we were provided with no seats, i decided to go talk to [[Amalas Sylnala]] and see if i can sit beside her and she welcomes me with open arms ofcourse.

The party gets engaged and most importantly, [[Caspar Dorthana Ⅲ]] is no longer a bastard and an actual Dorthana

During our debriefing with the Dorthanas, we discovered that collectively we managed to suppress all of the leaks. Cover all the bases for establishing relationships (except katya but that was on purpose), as well as gained all the intelligence that we desired. We then get paid a surprising amount of gold.
