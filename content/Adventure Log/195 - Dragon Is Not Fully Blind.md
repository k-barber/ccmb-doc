Man I hate hanging out with these guys, that was horrible. Tittlin is more suited for these longer range combats than I am. It feels like everyone is in the loop about where this path is except for me. Im finally excited to be able to get some real loot out of this that could go to me. Sadly Ive had to share all of it with the rest of the party due to cooperative combat restraints, but maybe I can swipe something from this memory of theirs. 

We head on up through the mines trying to be as stealthy as possible and I finally understand why tittlin bitches and whines cause these guys are really freakin loud. I manage to scout ahead finding 4 Ogres surrounding a seemingly dead mind flayer. I manage to fly through the walls to get a good vantage point. After having a brief discussion with Merric, we decide to hypnotic pattern the ogres and take them out 1 by 1 in order to investigate the room. We do manage to deal with the Ogres before they even get a chance to do anything with us.

We rummage around the caves trying to look for magical things when I accidentally run into the Amethyst Dragon. I thought this thing was entirely blind so It was sort of unintentional to get "caught". Running down the hallway I scream to the party to RUN and the dragon immediately flies past me and blocks the exit. I try to sneak through walls to get away from him but it doesnt seem to work as he finds me.

*Death*

Tittlin's log, we gotta stop doing this. The Ittlin brothers are gonna have quite the headache. Turns out we dont have the material components to resurrect Rittlin. Turns out he had also lost my BOW. So now I dont have anything to shoot with. Might have to go do a mission on my own. We pool our money together to get him up.  We decide it is in our best interest to sleep on our plans before making any decisions.

Upon waking, Momen learns a new spell that can extend the time frame of dying or something like that. We choose to go look at that memory path that spesof and momen had before the memory faded from their minds. We get to the place and there seems to be some sort of fortress with dwarven runes on it to protect the place but it seems to be rather dismantled with rubble in front of it. 

Inside was a letter and a book left for momen, seeminly by one of his old students. Seems like a real go getter but I also hate the guy cause he took some fun loot from the place.  We do manage to find some pretty nifty magical nick nacks but other than that nothing of big use.
