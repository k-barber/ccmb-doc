- killed most, knocked out one  
- tricked another one by impersonating one of the bandits  
- stalemate at the pipe  
- 5013 had enough and went in shooting fire  
- Everyone else charged in  
- Johanna taunted most of the bandits  
- Tittlin got hurt and retreated  
- The bandit captain and Spesof had a 1 v 1, no items, final destination, fox-only  
	- Spesof dealt massive damage  
	- bandit captain was too dummy thick  
	- Spesof started to bleed out  
- 5013 knocked out the bandit captain  
- Tittlin rolled a nat 20 to stabilize Spesof  
- found some ointment, that 5013 identified as Keoghtom's ointment  
- found a letter addressed to Gregory, talking about some rare cargo - a bird

	- supposed to meet a caravan up the north road at the crossroads.
