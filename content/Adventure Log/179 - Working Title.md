* Head out of [[Wurmrise]] and back into [[Cedar Combe]]
* [[Caspar Dorthana Ⅲ]] is waiting in the [[Cedar Combe Monster Bashers]] building tell us he's been ordered to gather us to help take control of the [[The Astain Wetlands]]
* There are rumours that [[Caylbaid ― The Quiet]] is still residing in the Wetlands
* He proposes that we head to the smaller towns of the Wetlands first
* Suggests that we go to [[Talonmouth]] last (where we last seen Caylbaid)
* Even though The Wetlands are under Datrius, it is also largely in control of Caylbaid so the goal is to remove his power in the lands
* The goal is to simply do it politically rather than do so violently with force
* Caspar was unaware that [[Amalas Sylnala]] was in kahoots with Caylbaid on a political and romantic level
* Given all this information we definitely will be doing Talonmouth last
* Caspar asks us if we could use [[The Wyvern]] to voyage the journey as a larger ship likely wouldnt be able to make the full journey in the swampland
* We create a plan and Caspar and plans to return on Onesday to set sail
-----
* Momen has a memory of [[Truthstride]]'s Prophecy and how it was sort of contradictory to Caspar's plan
* We decide that we are simply going to inform Caspar about the prophecy sooner rather than later - Running down the road to go retrieve him and soon after collectively give him the information on the prophecy
* We hand over a written copy of the Blood Thirsty Beast to Caspar
* Our goals are now to sort of appease [[Giemrayt ― The Gentle]] and include him in the plan based on the prophecy
* Momen decides he is resurrecting a dragon as a Skeleton rather than a Zombie
* Steve French doesnt like the Dragon that was resurrected 
* Momen takes the dragon out of town and flies it - you can see the excitement
* Spesof plays with beard wax
---
* We head off to [[Knight Faire]] to check on our boat in preparation for the travels to the Wetlands
* I ask around on whether or not there were updates with what was going on with the Wyrmwoods
	* It would appear that [[Katya Wyrmwood]] has run away.
	* recent development - no info on why or where she went to
	* Spesof and I go to the castle to see whats going on but the wall
	* Guards tell us that Tittlin is wanted
	* Tittlin lies and says hes tittlin but then finds out theres a reward so Tittlin gets Rittlin to turn Tittlin in
