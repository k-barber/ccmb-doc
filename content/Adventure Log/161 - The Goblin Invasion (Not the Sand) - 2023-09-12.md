Tittlins Log

We analyze the field and decide to take the left side as to avoid fighting some of the larger enemies to the east, fighting our way to the stables. Our first combatants are a Worg and a couple of goblins. Spesof makes his first attack to show us all that the worg isnt much of an issue, while the goblins retaliate with some bow attacks. A Hobgoblin steps out from behind a wall and lays a whole bunch of dart attacks on spesof doign a surprising amount of damage. Seeing this, i decide to wanted the hobcoblin and curve an arrow around [[Caspar Dorthana â…¢]] directly into its throat, killing it instantly.

After dealing with the goblins I GET FUCKING STABBED IN THE BACK BY A STUPID ASS GOBLIN WHILE I WASNT PAYING ATTENTION. A hobgoblin stealhy bitch comes in and simply assassinates a whole bunch of guard so I also take him out too. Momen and his skeleyboys move towards the mage and check him out. Caspar meanwhile is beating up another large creature in an owlbear. 
MOmen goes and helps out spesof as he gets himself surrounded by the bugbears he attacked

I come over to also aid in the efforts by perching myself up on a wall and attacking whoever my eyes can see. We continue to fight the goblins and bugbears and what not until our next foe which looks like itll be a bunch of Iron Cobras
We hear a champion enemy do champion things and mow down a bunch of guard meanwhile Caspar manages to get paralyzed yet again by one of the iron cobras

The cobras come our way and the battle seems to pile into one big mosh bit of fighting
I decided to get a better look of the battlefield, pulling out my grappling hook and climbing my way to the top. Suddenly though I have a memory lapse and go blank, not knowing what is going on. I came to at the top of the Baracks and looked around, noticing that no time had really passed and kept going with the battle

These Cobra fucks are annoying, it appears that I dont really have any way to deal with them from my bow
The Champion comes over and slices and dices into Caspar and I DONT LIKE IT, this guy is more of a snake hitting a paralyzed ape than the cobras. smh
Momen keeps his effort on the iron cobras so that they can be widdled down while Spesof and I dont do much of anything to them
Momens skeletons surround the Champion and continuously beat him while he is defenseless like a bunch of bullies beating a kid in elementary school

The Mage on our side come up and just fireballs EVERYTHING in the backline here killing off many goblins and stuff, but the snake is still standing
I then take out that champion with what little health he must have had at that point and celebrate on top of the building

One of the snakes Charms Caspar which is a little concerning but we manage to deal with the remaining snakes before it becomes a problem
Spesof charges into the devastator in the distance and kills it
while finding a Chuul in a random cooking room

We head into the stables and find ourselves in a very whacky room with a bunch of worgs and 4 glowing crystals taking the shape of a rectangle in each corner of the room
We assume that these magic crystals are whats powering the shields in the main tower
There are mines surrounding the crystals and I see one and shoot it
It blows the living hell out of the crystal and the wall

I start shooing a whole bunch of the mines and on my way to the back of the room, all of a sudden the pile of hay turns INTO A FREAKING HYDRA, along with general Wrolets in a pile to the east. Spesof comes up to charm the Hydra so that is no long an issue for me. I guess its time to focus on the General

The worgs start working on spesof but momen has another plan in mind, using a gravity sink holl to attack a whole bunch of the worgs
I then try to move away from the hydra and accidentally run into a hobgoblin. I charm that guy and convince him that the General is an Imposter and he goes on his way to attack the general

There appears to be a hidden Hobgoblin somewhere that darts the Hydra and it loses its charm, worrying me greatly as i am right beside him, and hitting me many times. I feel the pain as its the first time ive really been hit the whole time

Spesof blows the Horn of  Valhalla and We ride from there on
