- The party followed Emmanuel Foster's ledger to Elkwood
- After speaking to the Reeve, the party learned that Prince Nicholas had ransacked the town
- 5013 spoke to old man Proudmead who told the party about the Quickfield Caravan and about how it was led by Eldon Porridgepot, Merric's father
- During the Datrus/Torveldus war, Eldon ran humanitarian missions, which pissed off both Datrus, and Torveldus
- The caravan operated out of Elkwood, so it was raised, Eldon was killed, and his wife was imprisoned
- Foster managed to escape with his life (and the ledger) and fled to Cedar Combe
- Having learned this information, the party decided to head back to Cedar Combe to speak to Merric
- Tittlin asked around, and found someone who knew about [[JÃ¸rgen Olesen]]
- Tittlin greased his palms and found out some info
- Olesen's caravan was run out of town and should still be derailed on the north road
- They were primarily carrying live cargo - If you approach you should be wary of a powerful gladiator they were transporting
- The party came back to Cedar Combe and talked to Merric, who pulled out his father's ashes and proved to be no help
- 5013 showed the Illegible Book to Goras, who revealed that the symbol on it was from the Swift Earth tribe that was wiped off the map.
- The tribe used to exist in what is now northern Torveldus.
