We countinue pushing forward onto the keep while having a steady flow of routes out of the enemy. Doing well with our own troops as well, so far it seems only some of momen's men have been routed

We have taken out most of the front line at this point and are beginning to move in on the siege weapons

[[Phillip Dorthana]] leads the charge into the keep and OH BOY does he go, the team really rams themselves right into the center of the keep just outside the building

We quickly start taking out all of the siege weapons and remaining units OUTSIDE of the castle ([[Elkmire Keep]]) with ease

Things start taking a turn as we find it harder and harder to take down these siege weapons, taking casualties at a much high rate than before

We do however keep pressing on and slowly widdle them away
