- The party went to go retrieve Pisces
- Tittlin grabbed a bandit and Johanna tried to seduce him, but he turned out to be racist, so they tied him up and left him in the corner to think about his attitude
- Party started to fight with the bandits, and by fight I mean 5013 launched 2 fireballs on top of Johanna and the enemy commanders
