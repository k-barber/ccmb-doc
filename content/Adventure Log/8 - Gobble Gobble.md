Killed some goblins at a turkey farm

---

From Roll20:

- Went to kill some goblins that had attacked a turkey farm
- sniped the two goblins in the front
- sniped a goblin and bugbear from the camp on the right
- Johanna and Spesof charged forward while Tittlin and 5013 kept sniping
- Johanna got knocked unconscious
- Spesof raged, and 5013 enlarged Spesof
- Spesof cut down 3 goblins in 12 seconds
- The final bugbear, upon seeing a giant half-orc cut down his remaining allies, decided to book it.
