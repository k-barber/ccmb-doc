Tittlins Log: 27th of Mardoll, 697
We sought out a gift for the bridal party and have decided to get a Mirror of Positive Reinforcement. Cool and cute gift and I am a genius for thinking of it
Looking into the gathering, we determine that there may be an attempt at conflict so Spesof is going to be dressing as a guard and armed for the event
I decide I am going to be an attendant, and Momen decides he is going to be a mage
We ask about the specifics about parts of the celebration before it happens for clarity
I take an attempt at figuring out more about katya along the way
she wants a partner and I want a partner, we have so much in common
Katya likes the finer things, which is uncommon in the GBE which is more agriculturally inclined
I spend some money to get cleaned up and buy some good smelling fumes to wear at the event
On the first day of the wedding we meet with [[Felicia Dorthana]] and her two sons [[Phillip Dorthana]] and [[Caspar Dorthana â…¢]]
Phillip really has nothing going for him
Caspar is clearly in his prime
We enter the party after being addressed and I immediately venture outside to investigate the cool statues
The statues are blessed with runes that allow for areas where people can only hear and be heard within those areas which is pretty cool
I post up outside and try to catch a gaze at Katya, gaining a slight interest of hers
After not getting it, we all follow [[Merric Porridgepot]] inside
Some more people enter as we do
Duke Agnar Kallestad called us over and asked us about the matchign of the bridal party and I IMMEDIATELY open my mouth and decide that will be all i say in this affair
He wasnt satisfied with our answers, Wasnt mad at us, but wasnt as happy with the information recieved
We then head upstairs to talk ith Phillip Kallestad
We stroke beards together
Katya and [[Thalia Von Aureaveil]] seem somewhat interested in us and over hearing our conversation
Countess Scarlet Datrus Looks at Momen with interest and ends up wanting to become a magic student 
[[Nils Strasburg]] and his children then show up and immediately split up seeking other parties at the event
I go over and help out phillip in his effort of landing [[Yosefina Oberstein]] and invite them over for a private lunch
We then go and talk to Viscount Wyrmwood and Eichenwald in the corner
