- Merric called in a favour with someone from Kemany and the party went to [[Niflheim]]
- Fought imps and a succubus who charmed [[5-0-13]] with visions of armies and used him to shield her escape
- Collected a number of obols from corpses around the place
- Paid the ferryman to bring them across the river styx
- Found a crypt surrounded by exploding urns - which [[Johanna]] promptly jumped into, nearly becoming salsa
- Spesof correctly navigated through the urns and retrieved the horn of Valhalla
- Met [[Gunnarr Olafson]]'s spirit worm at the night hag's house
- Ding-dong ditched the night hag and after a brief fight, she slammed the door shut
- Broke down the door, and discovered the night hag had disguised herself as [[Eva]] - but the disguise was not enough to trick Johanna's nose (divine sense)
- The party killed the night hag
- [[Tittlin]] opened the night hag's treasure chest, which immediately exploded, nearly killing Eva if not for [[Spesof Beegstick]]'s danger sense and human shield
- [[Níðhöggr ― The Serpent|Níðhöggr]] chased the party out of Niflheim
