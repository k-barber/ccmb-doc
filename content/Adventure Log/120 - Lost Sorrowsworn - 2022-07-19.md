I woke up and the evil hash slinging slasher was dead

I took out my spy glass and guided the team away out of the forest, now that we know how to get out of here

Theres a sign on the tree...

It tells us we SHOULDNT do what we were told to do to get out, this is very annoying

Momen says we should follow the sign rather than the green dragon?

We have decided that we are going to tie the skeleton to a rope and send him backwards through the ridge

We went backwards through the ridge and it was totally fine

time stops moving when in the woods

We immediately grabbed a barrel and filled it with drinking water so we dont get fucked again

We forage for food to get some more rations and prepare for our reentrance into the woods.

but before hand we might want to go update the information with the people who sent us on the quest

We clear the air and we plan on killing the sorrowsworn first and reevaluating our use in this area

We then head back into the Fey Wilds

We walked into the fortress pursuing the Lost Sorrowsworn, when a Purple fog descended upon us and made us damage ourselves with bad thoughts

I tried to be stealthy on our approach but the fucking Dead Lover and his Dead Lover are loud as fuck

but, because I care, we move together

We started the battle and this thing wants to stay very far away from us

I tried shooting it and it did nothing to me

Wait I lied

it just fucked the shit out of spesof my goodness

Momens bells really destroyed this thing and we were able to defeat it thanks to him

It was really difficult for me to shoot at it but we got there

We did some foraging before going to bed, momen managed to bag a hare and drink its blood so i guess thats a positive

We set up the tiny hut, sleep, wakeup and head north to the angry boy

We got to the same area we were at before with the giant tree on the hill and I started to feel suuuuper angry again

I dont know why

but im angry
