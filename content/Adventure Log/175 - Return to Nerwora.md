The train pulls into the station in [[Coltoise]] and we disembark, needing to switch trains in order to travel to [[Wustus]]. Having... lost my armour in the fight with the beholder, I needed to procure a new set. Given that Coltoise is a mining town, I take advantage of our layover to buy the necessary mithril. This time, I'll go for a full set of plate armour. I'm not risking my life a second time if I have any choice in the matter.

As we return to the platform, we pass a departure sign for Wustus. I hear Tittlin mumble something under his breath about "Wustusians". I try to correct him, informing him that the appropriate demonym is "Wustan", but he shakes his head, saying it's "all about the Wustussy". Not understanding what he's going on about, I reply with a noncommittal "I see". Thankfully, the train arrives, saving me from having to see where that conversation would go. There's no longer enough traffic for a full passenger train, but this one looks like there are even fewer passenger cars than when I left. At least the carriages are nicer than the previous train.

After stopovers in [[Torlare]] and [[Courrault]] where the train drops off most of the freight, we arrive in [[Ishtarim]]. I make sure to dust myself off and clean up a bit before I get off the train to make sure I'm presentable.


- Feels good to be back somewhere clean
- Warning Tittlin of getting kicked out for sleeping on roofs

Given that we're in town for breakfast, I recommend we visit the Sweet Angel, a restaurant that I would frequent for breakfast. After a brief introduction of Spesof and Tittlin to the Maître d' in which I once again wonder about the company I keep, we sit down and look at the menu. Nothing new on it catches my eye, so I order my usual.
