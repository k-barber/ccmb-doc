- After killing a number of goblins, the party discovered the goblin invasion plan, a goblin diary, and Plok - a smart bugbear who was bullied by the other bugbears
- The party met [[Giemrayt â€• The Gentle]] - a young green dragon who was watching over his younger siblings, one of whom was sick
- Johanna healed that dragon baby, so Giemrayt let the party wander about without eating them

- While Giemrayt was distracted, the party opened a secret lockbox and found the Amulet of the Devout
