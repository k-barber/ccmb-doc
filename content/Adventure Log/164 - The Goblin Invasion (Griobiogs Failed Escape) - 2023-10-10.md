Yes this is the adventure log written by yours truly tittlin

Spesof peers into the spiky pit that the leading hob goblin jumped into to notice that he wasnt there at all and it seemed to be some sort of ruse. We radio in that [[Warlord Griobiog]] has made his attempted escape and that people should be on the lookout. Momen and I peer into the hole to look for any traps or ways that there could have been escape. It appears that there was a trap door on the side of the wall that the guy probably jumped through as spesof heads through 
Spesof finds him at the ground floor and I head down to hang out with him

We then begin to negotiate with the Warlord on the matter of his capture

The Warlord makes his pleas to us to decieve people and we collectively agree that trying to decieve the nobels in efforts to spare the warlords life wasnt a road we wanted to go down. In response we try to tell Griebiog that he will have to prove he would be an asset worth keeping alive and he responds with trying to prove to us the he was an asset we should want to keep alive for our own gain.

The Warlord does a good job convincing us that he would be valuable to us and we go to get the Duke in order for him to assess the information

I go get [[Alfred Oberstein â…¢]] and in the process him and the torveldan's are having a hissy fight over who gets to keep [[Elkmire Keep]], I try to resolve the issue but end up probably making things worse. [[Merric Porridgepot]] comes out to check up on me and decides to entertain the party while I take the Duke inside to talk to the Warlord
The warlord, on the inside then makes his case to the Duke personally

The cours eo faction we had in mind, was to dress up the brute as the actual "Warlord" given the way he is built and give him up as the warlord. The Duke needs some convincing but it didnt work well from me. The Duke wasnt convinced. Momen then tries to play it out a different way where the empress could utilize the Warlord in ownership to show her true power.
The Duke then feels like this is a relatively okay play to atleast try and convince the empress of. In return the Duke then says hell need a favour from us in return potentially.
We move along with the plan

Fitty and Phillip come up and inform us that the necromancer had gotten away
Fitty and spesof go up to collect Klobdocs
and Momen and I Attempt to solve a puzzle

We ended up solving the puzzle only to find a super magic box that seems to be setup to keep whatever is inside on the inside rather then keeping the outside out

We then proceed with our plan on the political issue and escort the hobgoblins / griobiog out

We then present the group and try to provide with some solutions on how to deal with the vacant fortress. There was a suggestion to provide a civilian run group from both people and a festival in place to celebrate the victory
This is an agreed upon method having no military of either side able to accommodate the land (for now)
We then make our way back through the battlefield back to the cedercomb monster bashers

Griobiog has been detained as we arent capable of doing that ourselves
