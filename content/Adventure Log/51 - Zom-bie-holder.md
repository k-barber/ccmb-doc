Baron Dorthana asked the CCMB to help clear out the Dorthana catacombs.

The party encountered a flameskull, and a banshee which shrieked and alerted the zombie beholder forcing the party to retreat

After a short rest, they dove back into the catacombs, recovering a potion of greater healing (which was actually a potion of poison)

The party fought against the beholder zombie and Spesof got turned into ash, which Tittlin quickly caught in a bucket
