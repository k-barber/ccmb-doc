- CCMB investigated some mysterious disappearances by the river in the small fishing village of Cowford
- They attempted to lure out the river monster by creating an illusion of Meric floating on a barrel in the middle of the river, but it didn't seem to fool the monster (or it simply didn't notice)
- Meric then hopped onto Johanna's shoulders and she waded into the river, and some small crocodiles burst out of the water but were quickly dealt with.
- A giant crocodile, Bruce, then appeared from the other side of the river.
- Just before being dealt a fatal blow, it sunk back into the water and two Mermen showed up, announcing that it was their pet and demanding an explanation.
- After some convincing, the party directed them to other rivers to settle in.
- The party decided to do some further investigation to confirm the death of Mr. Fishstick's daughter.
- Unfortunately, they found the daughter's necklace in the stomach of one of the smaller crocs.
- They returned to town to give it to Mr. Fishstick, and Meric performed a beautiful somber ballad.
