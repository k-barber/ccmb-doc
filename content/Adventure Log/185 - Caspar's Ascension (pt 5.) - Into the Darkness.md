We briefly go over our plans for how we are going to approach the [[Talonmouth]] situation and convince them to accept [[Caspar Dorthana â…¢]]. It is ideal to have [[Amalas Sylnala]] on board rather than against this plan. Our focus is going to be on simply impressing the High Priest - whom are the biggest fans of birds, so I'm going to be bringing Pisces along with me on the adventure.

We make our way to Talon Mouth, it seems rather similar to before, the same person even greeted us at the entrance. Before heading to the Temple, we stop in the towns shops first, specifically to see if there was a Spellcasting focus that Momen could use temporarily. I believe he picks up the wand

Momen asks me to ask my "Friends" on info about the Priest and the Town's Religion. The High Priest is rather dedicated to his religion and isnt corrupt or anything like that - likely not to be a loaded lad. Momen and Spesof spoke to the lower priests and they talked about "the Winged Mother" and emphasized freedom and laid back attitude.

We go and meet with the High Priest. Theres already some bickering about the orphanage that blew up conspicuously the last time we were here. We introduce Caspar to the High Priest Silver Spear and discuss what our reasoning for visiting was. The Priest immediately understands that theres a decision to be made on whether to choose betwen Amalas and Caspar. I try to persuade the High Priest with Pisces but it doesnt seem to make much of a difference.

Upon the suggestion that we could do something for him to convince him to lean in Caspars favour, The High Priest offers us a task to clear out an old temple of the priests so that they could potentially occupy and maintain it again. The place is occupied by about a dozen Drow or so.

We head on over to the temple and sure enough there is a Drow dragging a spider in sight after we had entered, alrhough it was distracted and hasnt seen us here. With one shot I was able to take him out. I guess it really wasnt that hard to kill him. Momen turns me invisible and I press forward and check out whats going on. Theres tons of spider webs and I can hear some elves speaking elvish in the distance. There was an Drider and a Drow arguing over chores and eventually the Drider full on eats the Drow. I do some reconnaissance and notice its a big loop with 2 Driders and 2 Drow.

I go back and let momen and Spesof know what was going on and we press forward to attack the first Drider. We get through most of it but it eventually runs away and lets the rest of the place know we are here. Momen and Some Drow do a pile of stinky in the middle of the intersection and no one can see anything. I set up a Bullseye lantern out in front and momen and I prone. We trade a bunch of shots and nothing happened until Momen decided to Gravity Sink Hole the Darkness and knocked out the guy who was focusing on the darkness.  The battle then Ensues fully with the Many Drows and Driders.

Momen being overwhelmed decides that Sinkhole 2.0 is a good Idea and obliterates a bunch of the back line drow while being attacked up close by another. We end up taking a few out but another darkness gets cast and some silly blind attacks go out. Killing a few people here and there. We managed to kill off the rest of the enemies in a swift and tidy manner before Momen dies.
