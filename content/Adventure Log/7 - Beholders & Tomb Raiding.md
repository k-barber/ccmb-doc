From Roll20:

## Beholder quest

- Talked to Jacob Dorthana & Goras
	- Learned that Jacob himself hadn't seen the monster, but had lost a group of guards he had sent to secure the castle  
	- Goras expressed doubt that the monster was a beholder
	- Jacob explained that while he wanted the castle, he much preferred to get back the golem caretaker, Gordon  
- Johanna convinced the group to just go and take a look to see if there really was a beholder
- Johanna snuck into the castle, saw a goat and heard some strange noises
- Spesof barged in and came face to face with a beholder ??? (It only had 4 eyestalks, so it was missing 6)
	- The beholder revealed it was Gordon, the caretaker, and set up a dining table.
- After questioning the beholder, you learned that it was waiting for Jacob to arrive  
- Tittlin asked for something to prove that the group met the caretaker, and it gave the group his tie
- The group informed Jacob that the beholder was actually Gordon, showing the tie as proof
- Jacob came with the group and met Gordon
- Mission Accomplished
- Happy ending, except for those guards
- Received a lot of $, and leveled up, also got a wand of binding.

	- Johanna threw a box of explosives on the fire
	- Unfortunately the webbing did not affect the Horror and it flew out of the way before the explosives went off

	- Tittlin Burned some books and a bookcase, revealing a lever and a secret room  
	- Johanna went to explore the secret room
	- Spesof checked out the crypt that the Horror was from
	- 13 got his ass kicked by the horror, and eventually ran away and hid behind a door  
	- Everyone went to go check out the secret room
		- There was a chest filled with fat stacks of cash
		- There was a grave (Hamish Wilson) that had been broken out of
	- The Helmed Horror went back to its crypt
	- 13 launched a spell at it
	- Johanna cast "Shield of the Faithful" on herself, presumably out of spite towards 13  
	- 13 got knocked unconscious
	- Spesof jammed the bloody shield into and around the crypt; nothing happened  
	- Tittlin used a healing potion to bring 13 back to the land of the living
	- The Helmed Horror attacked Johanna, breaking her concentration
	- Everyone beat the shit out of it.
