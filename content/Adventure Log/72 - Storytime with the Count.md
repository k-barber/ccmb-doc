- The party came up with a convincing story as to what happened, and it goes like this:
    - Count Dorthana and Baroness Eichenwald slept together after Dorthana's inauguration
    - Due to the differences in their positions, Baroness Eichenwald didn't send word to the Count and simply avoided questions about Caspar's paternity
    - Now that Caspar is getting older, the baroness needed to resolve the issue and so sent one of her servants to work in the Count's kitchen and find a suitable event for her to meet with him and discuss the matter privately
    - While there, the servant heard word of other kitchen staff attempting to assassinate the Count, so he sent word to Lady Eichenwald
    - Lady Eichenwald hired the CCMB to save the count's life since they had a history with the Count's uncle and would likely be trusted
    - The CCMB went to retrieve the count's cat in an attempt to ingratiate themselves to him, and in the process chased Burnidu Diltheth, the mastermind of the assassination, out of the city
    - The CCMB returned the count's cat, and with the count, rooted out any traitors in the mix
    - For their work in saving the count's life and dealing with the Torveldans, the CCMB were granted a knight's fee, and Lady Eichenwald ascended to Viscountess
    - Once a Viscountess, lady Eichenwald informed count Dorthana about Caspar, who decided to do the noble thing and marry lady Eichenwald
- A mage from the Spire of Dizif then cast a spell on everyone who knew the truth, compelling them to recount the above version of events
    - Attempts to subvert the compulsion will result in death, allegedly
