## Lady Melisenda Becomes Aodreia (The Public Story)
[[Aodreia Datrus Ⅰ ― The First Datrus|Lady Melisenda]] was born in [[Elkenalden]] during it's occupation by the Primal Host. She was born to a small group of rebels that lived in hiding in the city. Melisenda was a beautiful girl with minor healing powers, so she was liked by those who knew her and hidden away from the goblins. Unfortunately when she was 23, the goblins discovered her family and attacked. Melisenda fled the city and ran into a nearby cave. It was cold and dark, but with the goblins close behind, she had no choice but to keep going. When she reached a dead-end, she begged the gods for salvation, and as the goblins attacked she received a divine intervention. 


- Eventually, she came upon a dragon in a cave of ice
- The dragon was taken by her beauty and tried to enchant her, but she fought back
- Melisenda made a bargain - if the dragon would grant her the power to kill the goblins, she would bear the dragon's children
- The dragon agreed, and granted her power

## Lady Melisenda Becomes Aodreia (The State Secret)


## The Defeat of the Gray Ear legion
This was the first major battle of the war. The Gray Ear legion, were the chief strategists of the Primal Host and had occupied Elkenalden. After gaining powers from [[Aodreia ― The Lord of Ice]], Lady Melisenda gathered a number of soldiers to her side. After a number of small skirmishes, . defeated them by poisoning the river that flows through Elkenalden. Many on both side perished, but it killed the hobgoblin warlord. Since then, it is considered bad luck to draw water from the river. Lingering concerns about the safety of the water is why [[Ishtarim]] was initially made the capital, rather than Elkenalden.

## The Battle of Ishtarim
The largest battle for Datrian Independence was the Battle of Ishtarim, where Melisenda defeated the Red Demon legion, the host's strongest warriors (named "Red Demon" because it was composed entirely of red-nosed hobgoblins). Knowing that she could not defeat them in direct combat, Melisenda instead used a cunning strategy. She had her army assemble their tents and put their armor on stands. She then ordered them, unarmored, to swim up the rivers towards the town. While the goblins were busy scouting out her fake army, she used her mages to summon a firestorm upon the town. When the goblins tried to escape the fires and encroaching army by fleeing into the rivers, they discovered a wall of spears coming out of the water. Those that didn't burn were skewered and then flung into the river. Since then, Ishtarim has been an epicenter for magicians, and eventually the [[Nerwora Institute of the Arcane]] was established.

Halfway through the festival is the [[Battle of Ishtarim]], the fiercest battle in the war
