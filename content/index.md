Within these walls you'll find all sorts of interesting information:<br /><ul><li>People we've met</li><li>Places we've been</li><li>Conspiracies we've been implicated in...</li></ul></blockquote></div>

> I'm [[Goras Kelrieth]], the librarian. I manage the [[Cedar Combe Monster Bashers]]' library. If you have any questions, just ask!
> 
> For now, I'll give you a tour. To your left, you'll see a search bar, a dark mode switch, and the "Explorer". 
> 
> To your right, you'll see the "Graph View", "Table of Contents" and the "Backlinks" section.

## The Search Bar
---
> If you're looking for something in particular, use this to give me a shout. I'll scrounge up any information I can about the topic and give you a simple run down.
> 
> For example, if you asked me about "Prince Nicholas" I'd come back with these pages:

- [[Prince Nicholas Datrus (659 – )|Prince Nicholas]]
- [[Countess Eva Datrus Ⅳ (680 – )|Countess Eva]]

%%
```query
Prince Nicholas
```

> [!tip] Advanced Searching
> You can use "AND" and "OR" to link multiple search terms to narrow down results.

## The Explorer
---
> If you are simply looking to browse, the Explorer is your best friend. It shows all the contents of the library in neat, organized folders.
> 
> I'm not entirely sure who organized it all.

## Graph View
---
> The Graph view is a useful tool. It shows other related documents and allows you to quickly and easily switch between them. Simply click on a node to go to its page.
> 
> If you'd like to see the entire graph, and not just the current node's neighbours, you can click the small icon in the the top right.

## Backlinks
---
> The Backlinks section lists all the articles that link to the current one.
