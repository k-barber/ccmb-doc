A dwarven complex designed to hold a planar gate. It houses a small shrine to [[Marthammor Duin]], the dwarven god of exploration.

When the gate was first activated, the operator had accidentally set the dial code to the elemental demi-plane of ketchup. The ketchup erupted from the gate, causing a minor earthquake. The facility broke off the continent and was sent adrift, leaking ketchup all the way.

It now floats in the middle of the sea.
