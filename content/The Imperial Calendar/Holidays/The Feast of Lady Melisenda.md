## Battle Re-enactments and Effigy Burning
On each day of the feast, five battle re-enactments are held, totaling 35 re-enactments. Each re-enactment features one of the 35 Legions of [[the Primal Host]] and shows how Lady Melisenda defeated them. Historically, she only defeated 22 of them, as 13 had left to subjugate Torveldus, but the celebration has re-enactments for all 35 anyway.

The most notable re-enactments are:

1) The first re-enactment is [[The Datrian War of Independence#The Defeat of the Gray Ear legion|the Defeat of the Gray Ear legion]] the defeat of the Gray Ear legion, who were the chief strategists of the Primal Host.
2) Halfway through the festival is the [[Battle of Ishtarim]], the fiercest battle in the war where Melisenda defeated the Red Demon legion, the host's strongest warriors (named "Red Demon" because it was composed entirely of red-nosed hobgoblins). Knowing that she could not defeat them in direct combat, Melisenda instead used a cunning strategy. She had her army assemble their tents and put their armor on stands. She then ordered them, unarmored, to swim up the rivers towards the town. While the goblins were busy scouting out her fake army, she used her mages to summon a firestorm upon the town. When the goblins tried to escape the fires and encroaching army by fleeing into the rivers, they discovered a wall of spears coming out of the water. Those that didn't burn were skewered and then flung into the river. Since then, Ishtarim has been an epicenter for magicians, and eventually the [[Nerwora Institute of the Arcane]] was established.
3) The final re-enactment is the Battle of
