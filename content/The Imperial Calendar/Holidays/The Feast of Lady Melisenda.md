## Festivities
The primary festivities of the event are feasting, some battle re-enactments and effigy burnings. There are also speeches, poems, songs, and typically some food contests.

[[Elkenalden]] and [[Ishtarim]] have their own special festivities.

In Ishtarim, [[Nerwora Institute of the Arcane|Nerwora]] has several magical presentations, including magic fireworks.

In Elkenalden, they perform the Ritual of Flowing Waters. The Empress marches down to the river from the keep. Upon reaching the river she delivers a speech, wherein she promises to never again poison the river of Elkenalden. After the speech she bows and drinks from the river, then signals for the release of several funeral boats in honor of those who died during [[The Datrian War of Independence#The Defeat of the Grey Ear legion|the Defeat of the Grey Ear legion]].
### Battle Re-enactments and Effigy Burning
On each day of the feast, five battle re-enactments are held, totaling 35 re-enactments. Each re-enactment features one of the 35 Legions of [[the Primal Host]] and shows how Lady Melisenda defeated them. Historically, she only defeated 22 of them, as 13 had left to subjugate Torveldus, but the celebration has re-enactments for all 35 anyway.

The most notable re-enactments are:
1) The first re-enactment is [[The Datrian War of Independence#The Defeat of the Gray Ear legion|the Defeat of the Gray Ear legion]], who were the chief strategists of the Primal Host.
2) Halfway through the festival is the [[Battle of Ishtarim]], the fiercest battle in the war where Melisenda defeated the Red Demon legion who were the host's strongest warriors.
3) The final re-enactment is the Battle of Dawntomb Garrison.

During the feast there are also effigy burnings of various goblins, bugbears, worgs, and hobgoblins. The first effigy is always Warlord Shokor, but after that it's a free-for-all.
