## Waxing and Waning Months
---
Because the imperial calendar is a lunar calendar, it is tied directly to the phase of the moon. Specifically, a new moon indicates a new month. As such, one can use the phases of the moon and the stages of a month interchangeably. 

The waxing phase of the moon is when it is growing from an empty new moon, to a full moon. Similarly, the "wax" of a month is the first two weeks of the month as we "grow" into it. One week from the new moon, to the first quarter, and the second week from the first quarter to the full moon.

The waning phase of the moon is when it shrinks from a full moon to a new moon. A "wane" of a month is the last two weeks of the month. One week from the full moon, to the last quarter, and the second week from the last quarter to the new moon.

Typically dates are read in one of two ways:
	Threesday, 17th of Níðhöggr, 696

or more traditionally
	Threesday, 3rd of Waning Níðhöggr, 696

In short form, the first way becomes:
	696/11/17

and the second uses "X" or "N" to denote "waxing" or "waning" respectively
	696/11N/03


## Days of the Week
---
A week in the Imperial Calender is seven days, starting on Onesday and counting up to Fivesday. The sixth day of the week is Sunday and the seventh is Moonday.

Moonday is in sync with the cycle of the moon, so the first Moonday of a month will always be the first quarter moon, the second will be a full moon, the third will be a last quarter moon and the forth will be a new moon.
## Format of a Month
