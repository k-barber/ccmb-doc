[[Maglubiyet|Maglubiyet's]] Spear Goblin host of 53 legions, the largest host ever created. It was even larger than the [[The Primal Host]], which subjugated [[The Empire of Datrus]], until Aodreia Datrus recieved divine intervention.

It is lead by [[Warlord Griobiog]], who has brought together Hobgoblins, Bugbears and Goblins in a surprisingly disciplined manner.

More disturbing are reports that the host has brokered alliances with other groups, a move typically outside the stratagem of goblins.

A map found in the goblin strategic command center seemed to suggest that the goblins were based out of [[Elkmire Keep]], which would be very concerning.
