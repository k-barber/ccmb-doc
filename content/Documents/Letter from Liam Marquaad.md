>To the Cedar Combe Monster Bashers,
>
>I would like to thank you once again for saving me from the hands of those goblins. When I returned to Devilglen I was informed that your services were not paid for by my men, and that in fact they had no idea where I was.
>
>As such it seems that my behavior when we met was unbecoming, and that I am indebted to you all. While we may be from opposite sides of a border, good will ought to be rewarded and debts ought to be paid.
>
>Enclosed with this letter should be some coins as well as a signed warrant authorizing your group to enter Torveldus.
>
>It is the first such warrant I have issued, so the border guards may be weary of them. If the guards give you any trouble, give them the passphrase "Torveld mourns for Angelika" and they should let you pass without hassle.
>
>Should you ever find yourselves in Devilglen, please come to the keep and we shall host a banquet in your honor.
>
>Yours truly,
>	Earl Liam Marquaad of Devilglen
