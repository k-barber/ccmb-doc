[[Baronet Dmitriy Mashir]] wrote the following letter to his sister, before he died:

> Dearest sister,

> It has been many years since we’ve last seen each other, so I thought it would be good to send a letter.
> 
> The apple tree in our front yard seems to be a big hit. The kids sneak by and pluck them off the tree when they think I’m not looking. Folks come around for pie every so often. Apparently, the apples are quite big. Must be a lot of nutrients in the soil – guess we have Spencer to thank for that!
> 
> After those bandits came by, I figured we needed a bit more security, so I sprung for some fancy magic vault. Thing works just fine, though it’s a bit of a pain trying to remember the password. If I ever forget, I’m supposed to press the question mark button, and apparently they’ll send someone over.
> 
> Let me know how life is treating you.
> 
> Your brother, Dmitriy
