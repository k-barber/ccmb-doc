>To the Cedar Combe Monster Bashers,
>
>It is with great pleasure that I write this letter.
>
>First and foremost, I'd like to thank you for your recent work in removing the owlbear scourge from the Cedar Combe forests. Excellent work!
>
>As I was preparing to send the bounty for this quest to mr. Porridgepot, I realized that this was not the first time your group has helped the Great Badger Expanse Agricultural Society.
>
>Your name has appeared multiple times in our records; helping beekeepers, clearing goblins from farmlands, etc.
>
>As such, it is with a grateful heart that I am pleased to welcome you into the GBEAS!
>
>Don't worry, there no membership fees or anything like that.
>
>Enclosed you should find a green badge with the GBEAS logo on it, and on the other side your membership number and rank: Sprout.
>
>Show that badge to any participating merchants and you should receive a pleasant discount!
>
>If you are interested in a larger discount, or purchasing agricultural land within Cedar Combe's limits, we'll be sending some quests your way. Complete those and you'll _quickly_ shoot up through the ranks! 
>
>President of the Great Badger Expanse Agricultural Society,
>
>Aisaac Andon
