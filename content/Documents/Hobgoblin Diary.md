Most of the diary consists of silly doodles and what appear to be To-Do lists, but an entry near the end catches your eye.

> I am buzzing with excitement. I've never seen a host so large. Fifty three legions! Unbelievable.
> 
> [[Maglubiyet's Spear]] will without a doubt be remembered as one of the greatest hosts ever formed. Historians will write about us for ages! We may even surpass [[The Primal Host]].
> 
> [[Warlord Griobiog]] is an excellent strategist, proven enough by how he handles the other tribes. Under his guidance cowardly goblins fight to the death, and indolent bugbears keep at attention.
> 
> It's a fearsome sight to behold.
> 
> I do have some reservations though. Normally the library would be guarded by Iron Shadows as it moved, but since one of the training camps has been hit, we're short on men.
> 
> Aparently the library is going to be guarded instead by a single soldier. I don't care how strong they are, it should have a few more guards than that.
> 
> What's worse is that apparently this soldier isn't even one of our men, but someone that Warlord Griobiog has brokered an alliance with.
> 
> I'm not sure I trust an outsider with that kind of information.
